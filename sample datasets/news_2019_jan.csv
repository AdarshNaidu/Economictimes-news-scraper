"New year cheer for banks, NPAs see first fall since 2015","NPAs, the scourge of banks, just saw the first fall since 2015. Profitability, though, is still a worry.","Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India, which has been relentlessly pushing banks to recognise bad loans, believes that they may be over the worst with the industry likely reporting a decline in non-performing assets (NPAs) in the current fiscal year for the first time since 2015, when the regulator began tightening norms.The central bank forecast gross bad loans will decline to 10.3% of total loans by March 2019 from 10.8% at the end of September 2018 and 11.5% in March 2018. The net NPA ratio also registered a decline during the period.“In a sign of possible recovery from the impaired asset load, the GNPA (gross non-performing assets) ratio of both public and private sector banks showed a half-yearly decline, for the first time since since March 2015, the financial year-end prior to the launch of asset quality review,” RBI said in its 18th Financial Stability Report, the first since Shaktikanta Das became governor in December following Urjit Patel’s departure. “The banking stability indicator (BSI) shows that asset quality of the banks has improved, although profitability continues to erode.”The Indian banking industry was plunged into gloom after RBI’s asset quality review in 2015 forced lenders to reclassify many standard loans as bad assets. These had been shown to be standard by either evergreening or restructuring on terms that were impossible to achieve. Many corporate borrowers with revamped loans continued to struggle and default on payments.The turnaround will be good news for the government, which has been looking to shore up credit growth to spur economic activity and generate jobs. Financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar had told ET last week that bad loans of state-run banks were declining and that they had recognised most of their stressed assets.While the overall situation is improving, the jump in bad loans under a stress test scenario will leave many banks vulnerable and push them below minimum capital requirements, said the report. “Sensitivity analysis indicates that 18 SCBs (scheduled commercial banks), including all public sector banks (PSBs) under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) may fail to maintain the required CRAR (capital to risk weighted assets ratio) under a two standard deviation shock to the GNPA ratio, unless capital infusion takes place and banks improve their performance,” said the report.  Although the industry shows signs of stabilising, the gulf has widened between banks under PCA due to their weak finances and those with sufficient capital.“There has been a further widening between PCA and non-PCA PSBs,” it said. “While the non-PCA PSBs’ credit growth improved from 9.1% in March 2018 to 13.6% in September 2018 and deposits increased from 6.1% to 7.9% in the same period, the PCA-PSBs registered negative growth in both credit and deposits.”Patel quit as RBI governor following differences with the government over issues such as the restrictions on weak banks under the PCA regime, easing liquidity for non-banking finance companies and the level of reserves the regulator needed to hold.","Jan 01, 2019, 09:49 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/new-year-cheer-for-banks-npas-see-first-fall-since-2015/articleshow/67331225.cms
"RCom, Jio keep asset sale deal alive, extend deadline to June 28",Dot’s rejection of spectrum deal between telcos sparked speculation about fate of wireless asset sale.,"Mumbai: Reliance Communications (RCom) and Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) have extended till June 28 the term of the pact under which the Anil Ambani owned company will sell some wireless assets to the telco owned by elder brother Mukesh, aiming to quash talk that the agreement was dead.“Reliance Jio lnfocomm Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd, extended the term of the definitive agreement for the acquisition of specified assets of Reliance Communications Ltd and its affiliates to 28th June 2019,” Jio said in a regulatory filing on Monday.In a separate but similar filing, RCom said that the two operators have extended the “validity of the agreements signed on 28th December 2017 for sale of towers, fiber, MCNs (media convergence nodes) and spectrum of RCom and its affiliates to 28th June 2019.” That’s a six month extension from the original deadline of December 28. Both companies didn’t reply to ET’s emailed queries.While the Rs 17,000-crore pact covered four wireless assets, the spectrum was at the heart of the deal. It will allow Jio to strengthen its 4G airwave holdings and help RCom pare its Rs 46,000-crore debt by paying off financial lenders besides operational creditors such as Ericsson.RCom has already sold fibre and nodes to Jio for Rs 5,000 crore. “This announcement will stop all speculation that it was off the table,” said an executive, who didn’t want to be named.Speculation about the fate of the deal had been sparked by the department of telecommunications (DoT) rejecting RCom’s deal to sell spectrum to Jio about two weeks ago, saying it didn’t conform to airwave trading rules. JIO’S CONDITIONDoT’s decision followed Jio’s letter to the government seeking an assurance that it won’t be held liable for RCom’s past dues related to airwaves. In its letter, Jio further said that DoT should only clear the deal once the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco confirmed that RCom had fulfilled certain conditions agreed to between the two companies.DoT said Jio’s conditions were not in accordance with the government’s spectrum-trading norms, which stipulate that the buyer is liable for dues that haven’t been recovered from the seller.While the two telcos on Monday sought to convey that the deal was still alive, Jio added a condition in its statement: “The acquisition is subject to receipt of requisite approvals from governmental and regulatory authorities, consents from all lenders, release of all encumbrances on the said assets and other conditions precedent.” Industry insiders said this comment underlined that Jio hadn’t budged from its stance that it shouldn’t be held responsible for RCom’s previous dues.ROW OVER DUESRCom and DoT have battled over the government’s claim of spectrum-related dues worth Rs 2,947 crore. The dispute went up to the Supreme Court, which directed DoT to approve the RCom-Jio trading pact and accept a Rs 1,400 crore corporate guarantee, instead of a bank guarantee, as well as a parcel of land from an RCom subsidiary to cover the dues.But DoT was of the view that if anything went wrong with the corporate guarantee and the land parcel, it would hold the buyer of the airwaves – Jio in this case – liable for previous dues, a view which was unacceptable to the company.RCom has urged DoT to abide by the Supreme Court order and clear the deal, which the DoT has said it’s unable to do due to Jio’s conditions, leading to the continuing stalemate.The Anil Ambani-owned company, in its statement, added that the “transactions are to be consummated subject to various approvals that are presently in progress.” Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL), Jio’s parent, closed at Rs 1121.05, down 0.42% while those of RCom closed at Rs 14.39, down 2.04%, on the BSE on Monday.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:07 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/rcom-jio-keep-asset-sale-deal-alive-extend-deadline-to-june-28/articleshow/67331321.cms
India may hold talks to expand bilateral flying rights,"The meeting is set to take place on Jan 14, a day before the beginning of the two-day summit, which will be attended by representatives of about 30 countries, said people aware of the matter. ","India is likely to hold informal talks on increasing bilateral foreign flying rights with nearly nine countries including the United Arab Emirates, China and Saudi Arabia on the sidelines of the Global Aviation Summit to be held in Mumbai this month. The meeting is set to take place on January 14, a day before the beginning of the two-day summit, which will be attended by representatives of about 30 countries, said people aware of the matter. Foreign flying rights between two countries allow carriers from each side to operate a certain number of seats or services as agreed in the bilateral air services agreement. The development comes amid expansion of operations of Indian carriers such as IndiGo and SpiceJet to overseas destinations, although the Narendra Modi government has so far refrained from allowing additional flying rights to countries in Asia owing to the possible negative impact on domestic airlines. “There are about nine countries with which the government will hold informal talks on bilateral flying rights. Some countries like Qatar have requested to be part of those talks, as the current flying rights quota is almost getting exhausted,” said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ET had reported on October 4, 2018 that the Enforcement Directorate was investigating bilateral air services agreements signed with West Asian countries between 2001 and 2012. The probe will also examine the impact that the bilateral agreements had on the operations of debt-laden Air India. In October, the government had decided not to allow an increase in flights operated by carriers from countries such as Qatar, UAE, Singapore and China to India after domestic carriers objected saying their international plans would be hit. These countries had sought an increase on the grounds that the existing rights on the routes were utilised by Indian carriers as well. Indian carriers have used up rights to the UAE fully and those to Qatar up to about 90%. With new Singapore flights having been started, utilisation on that route has breached the 80% mark. Under the new civil aviation policy, any move to increase rights can only take place if Indian carriers utilise at least 80% of the entitlement on those routes.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:07 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/india-may-hold-talks-to-expand-bilateral-flying-rights/articleshow/67331351.cms
Hike plans to raise more funds in 2019,"India is now at an inflexion point with a majority of internet users on 4G, the person said, adding that the market is now offering better opportunity for apps like Hike.","Home-bred app Hike, which counts Softbank, Tencent and Foxconn as investors, would be looking to raise more funds in 2019 and will start experimenting with monetisation models from 2020 while it refocuses on messaging and stickers and strips out other services such as payments.A person familiar with the matter said that the company has shut down its Total app launched in January 2018 as part of its ‘back to the basics’ strategy which also envisages launch of a separate app for content that may be on the lines of a Tiktok – a China-based music video app - following a spike in interest in short videos apps in India as well.“In the last year and half, Hike focused on experimenting with products in new verticals, and added stuff at the cost of something else. In internet space, products evolve quickly and many a times, they evolve away from the core. A few months back, Hike decided to focus on its core, which is social,” the person said.India is now at an inflexion point with a majority of internet users on 4G, the person said, adding that the market now has good smartphone penetration offering better opportunity for apps like Hike, which is now focused on engagement, daily active users and further growth.Hike declined to offer comment for this story.The app, led by Kavin Mittal, has so far raised $261 million from investors, including Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings, manufacturing firm Foxconn Technology Group and the Bharti group. Its last fundraiser was in the fourth quarter 2016 when it raised $175 million by led by Tencent and Foxconn at the valuation of $1.4 billion.“A majority of the funds that we raised from the last round are still available. But late 2019 or 2020, we will be looking to raise more funds. Existing strategic investors would be a part, but we are open to new ones as well,” the person said.Following the last round of fundraising, Hike expanded its team, went on to explore multiple directions, launched new services within the app, and new features losing focus, the person said. It also expanded its team and added senior professionals at a huge cost.“That set us back by a year-and-a-half,” the person said, adding that most of those additional employees have left, features have been shut down, and the company has trimmed its manpower to 150 – from a peak of 350 - having shut down its Bengaluru office.The person added that Hike will now focus on stickers and voice to drive its messaging applications, with an aim to reduce dependence on the keypad. Besides, it will continue to work on privacy as a feature through its encryption technology in India.“The market has changed in India. When Hike raised large amount from Tencent, it wanted to build a WeChat like product and doubled down on content and daily active viewers. But they realised that that’s not the right way to go because the market is different here,” the person said. “The focus now is just to simplify the applications.”Hike’s biggest competitor in India is Facebook-owned WhatsApp that has an enormous base of over 200 million. Besides, it competes with the likes of Facebook Messenger and Google’s Hangouts.Having acquired companies like Creo, Zip Phones and InstaLively, Hike may look out for small companies to acquire to bolster and further develop its technology.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:07 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/hike-plans-to-raise-more-funds-in-2019/articleshow/67331337.cms
96% households get electricity connections,"Uttar Pradesh, which hosted close to half of the targeted unelectrified households, has achieved 100% electrification, a statement issued by the power ministry said.","NEW DELHI: The government has connected about 96% of households across the country with electricity supply, and hopes to take power lines to the rest by January 26, officials said.The government had initially targeted March 31 as the deadline for taking electricity lines to all households in the country that seek a connection. It later said the target would be met three months earlier, by December 31.Work in some regions has been delayed because of reasons such as legal tussle over a tender, recent assembly elections and difficulties in working in areas affected with Naxal violence, they said.The official website that monitors progress in providing electricity, the Saubhagya dashboard, showed that government has electrified 95.72% households, while 4.28% or 10,68,160 were left to be energised in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.Uttar Pradesh, which hosted close to half of the targeted unelectrified households, has achieved 100% electrification, a statement issued by the power ministry said. Since launch of the Saubhagya scheme, 74.4 lakh willing households have been electrified and the state government has declared saturation of all 75 districts.Of the 2.49 crore unelectrified households, 2.38 crore have been electrified. On an average, about seven lakh houses are being energised every week. Experts have said the newly connected households will get translated into growth in power demand within a year with the release of pent up and fresh demand from rural areas.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:23 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/96-households-get-electricity-connections/articleshow/67331418.cms
"Government mulling policy sops for Apple, others",The Cupertino-based technology giant is in talks with the Ministry of Commerce and the Department of Revenue to seek certain sops for its component manufacturers.,"New Delhi: The Centre is exploring specific policy incentives to woo Apple Inc along with other electronics manufacturers to make and export from India, said a top government official.The Cupertino-based technology giant is in talks with the Ministry of Commerce and the Department of Revenue to seek certain sops for its component manufacturers. The company is seeking a commitment of tax breaks for five years under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), besides income tax benefits for the proportion of exports made. Officials from the two ministries have sought inputs from the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) for the proposed policy tweaks, the person told ET.“Apple doesn’t see India as a large domestic market, so its plan is more export-driven,” said the official.Under the MEIS scheme, the government provides duty benefits of 2-4% depending on the product and the country to which it is being exported. MeitY is in favour of expanding India as a hub for electronics exports through these incentives. The government is keen to ensure that the entire electronics manufacturing industry benefits from any change in policy instead of sops being doled out only for Apple, the person said on the condition of anonymity. Apple did not reply to emailed queries from ET.According to the government official who briefed ET on the talks, since Apple is looking at India as an export hub for its products, the discussions are centred on tweaking existing policies that are export-focused or even making new ones. “Though MEIS has been extended to make it indefinite, they (Apple) are pushing us to give a commitment that this scheme will continue for five years,” the person said.The Ministry of Commerce and the Department of Revenue are concerned whether providing specific export incentives will put the country in conflict with the World Trade Organization’s stipulations. MeitY, on the other hand, has said that if the scheme has to continue, the government can give a commitment to Apple.Apple is also seeking income tax exemption on exports, which has again led to concerns if such a move will be WTO-compliant.MeitY has recommended that such an exemption can be given for 10 out of 15 years when the company starts to make profits. “The Department of Revenue is trying to work out a way since the concern is that other sectors may also ask for it,” the official added. The government may have to frame a new policy on incentives for High and New Technology Enterprises (HNTEs), which can then be extended to all companies that seek such sops, the official said.At present, Apple has contracted Bengaluru-based Wistron to manufacture its previous generation iPhones for the local market. ET reported on December 28 that Foxconn plans to invest Rs 1,500 crore in its Sriperumbudur plant to make newer versions of Apple smartphones in the country. Commerce minister Suresh Prabhu said last week that he would meet Apple executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January and discuss their plans of expanding manufacturing in India.In its earlier application submitted to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Apple had sought full duty exemption on manufacturing and repair inputs (raw materials), yield loss on inputs, components, capital equipment (including parts), and consumables for smartphone manufacturing and services/repair for a period of 15 years for both domestic and export markets.The government had, however, said it will not offer any special concessions to Apple.ET had reported in March that MeitY had asked Apple to come up with a fresh proposal. “Apple wanted a lot of exemptions which would have led to a situation of discrimination vis a vis other players. Therefore, we explained to them the whole position. My department is now in talks with them and I understand that they are keen to make India a hub for exports, so they are reworking their proposal,” minister for electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad had told ET.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:30 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/government-mulling-policy-sops-for-apple-others/articleshow/67331426.cms
"Wall Street rises, limps across the finish line of a turbulent year",,"NEW YORK: Wall Street advanced in low-volume trading on Monday as revelers gathered to ring in 2019, marking the end of the worst year for US stocks since 2008, the height of the financial crisis. Wall Street entered correction territory in late January and was challenged for much of 2018 by tariff jitters, rising interest rates, and fears of diminishing corporate profits.""Investors got complacent,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. ""People were positioned for the lack of volatility, and when that changed because of trade concerns and interest rates, people started repositioning and that started the cascade."" December was a particularly trying month for US equities. The S&P 500 saw its worst December since the Great Depression and the Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, or 20 per cent below its high. All three are down about 9 per cent since the beginning of the month.In the new year, investors hope for the removal of question marks that acted as significant headwinds in 2018, including US-China trade negotiations, the path of US Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, slowing corporate growth and economic fallout from the upcoming departure of Britain from the European Union, or Brexit, among other concerns. As 2019 gets underway, ""investors will be looking to corporate earnings, what happens with the trade negotiations and the body language of the Fed,"" Martin added. On Monday, renewed hopes for a resolution to the US-China trade dispute provided a glimmer of optimism for investors.US President Donald Trump indicated on Twitter that progress had been made toward a potential settlement of trade tensions between the United States and China which have plagued stock markets for much of the year. Trading volume was relatively light, owing to the holiday as the US federal government shutdown entered its 10th day. Healthcare and tariff-sensitive technology stocks, led by Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc , provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 on Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 265.06 points, or 1.15 per cent, to 23,327.46, the S&P 500 gained 21.11 points, or 0.85 per cent, to 2,506.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 50.76 points, or 0.77 per cent, to 6,635.28.All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in positive territory. But for the year, only healthcare and utilities ended 2018 higher.Energy , materials , communication services , industrials and financials were the biggest per centage losers of 2018, down between 14.7 per cent and 20.5 per cent from the beginning of the year.The 20.5 per cent drop of energy stocks in 2018 was largely attributable to crude prices plunging 38 per cent since early October.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.81-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded eight new highs and 98 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was 7.46 billion shares, compared with the 9.22 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

It’s time Gandhis came clean on Agusta: Devendra Fadnavis,Fadnavis added that raids conducted on Guido Ralph Haschke and interrogation of Michel has led to important dots being connected by the investigating agencies.,"Mumbai: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday questioned the Congress ‘silence’ on the alleged revelations made by AgustaWestland scam accused Christian Michel. Fadnavis claimed that in documents and in the recovered diaries, the Congress president was referred to as ‘R’ and the ‘son of the Italian woman who could be PM’.In a press conference, Fadnavis said the Congress and ‘the family that runs the party’ should answer the questions raised in the AgustaWestland scam.The CM said the scam was uncovered after the Italian investigative agencies conducted raids on Finmeccanica and came to know that there was big corruption in the deal. “Some Indian Air Force officers, other officials and political leaders were given bribes. The Italian court has already sentenced two people. In the Italian courts judgement,Sonia Gandhi’s name has come four times,”said the CM.Fadnavis added that raids conducted on Guido Ralph Haschke and interrogation of Michel has led to important dots being connected by the investigating agencies.“There are different names that have cropped up in court documents, mails and diaries, Sonia has been mentioned, there is reference to the Italian woman and her son who could be the PM, there is an R mentioned, there is also an AP. The Congress needs to answer as to why are the names being referred to and what is their connection to this?","Jan 01, 2019, 07:33 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/its-time-gandhis-came-clean-on-agusta-devendra-fadnavis/articleshow/67331458.cms
Stage set for general elections: Here's the political box office,ET looks at some of the issues set to dominate the political box office in the run-up to general elections.,"Election victories in three states and a coalition government in Karnataka have made the Congress aggressive, fancying its chances of leading an alliance at the Centre in 2019. But it’s not going to be an easy battle with the BJP, still the main formidable political force, and the NDA going strong despite some defeats. ET looks at some of the issues set to dominate the political box office in the run-up to the general elections.Farm, farmers & loan waiver Agencies The issue: There is a growing perception, fanned effectively by the Opposition, that the Centre has not done enough for farmers, especially on complaints about not getting the right price for their crop, lack of irrigation and affordable power.Significance: The recent Assembly elections have revealed that farm distress is an important electoral issue, and in many cases, a deal breaker for the electorate.Congress has countered populist measures such as one-time loan waivers. Party line: Congress has banked on farm loan waivers in successive elections. In the wake of suicides in Maharashtra’s parched Vidarbha region, Congress had announced complete farm loan waiver ahead of 2009 parliamentary elections.BJP, however, has always termed it as a quick-fix (the PM called it a lollipop) and has advocated long term reforms. Its promise of MSP for kharif crop at one and a half times the cost of production has not been implemented effectively.National security ki jung  Agencies The issue: It’s been a mixed bag for the government on the security front. While efforts to improve relations with Pakistan have not worked, despite an initial personal approach by the PM, the narrative of a strong government was boosted by the publicly announced surgical strikes into Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. A strong approach in tackling terrorism in Kashmir was adopted after the Pathankot attack.Significance: The government comes across as one having a no-nonsense approach on national security. That there has been no major terror attack on an Indian city in the past four years has been a big feather in the cap for the government.Party line: The surgical strikes, as well as the terror-free record will be the big planks the party is likely to go in for when it comes to elections.The surgical strikes are being showcased as a unique military achievement. Congress has sought details of the kills during the operation to puncture the government claims.The minority report  Agencies The issue: Muslims are evidently among the most restless social segments. As a community, they feel they have been divided due to vote bank politics and now somewhat marginalised on the larger political scene.Significance: The community would gain the most the in a grand alliance-like situation against the BJP, preventing a split of the minority vote. However, the BJP’s rise has ensured that the community finds it difficult to obtain tickets.The party line: The BJP line is ‘sabka saath sabka vikaas’, where it claims that no individual is discriminated on basis of religion. It terms UPA’s policies as one of minority appeasement. But increased incidents of mob lynching and cow protection have polarised the heartland.Mandir, cow & polarisation  Agencies The issue: Ratcheting up the Ram Temple issue has led to voices of Hindutva and polarisation gaining ground in the BJP. RSS affiliates hope it will consolidate the Hindu votes overriding the caste support of some regional parties.Significance: The frenzy around the Ram temple at Ayodhya has helped BJP electorally in the past. Cow protection issue has also helped whip up passions though Hindus have also lost l ives during riots. The Bulandshahr incident is a case in point.The party line: BJP has officially maintained it will wait for the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram temple issue. Though the party has condemned cow slaughter related violence, mob lynching and riots, many of its own lawmakers have made controversial remarks in support of the acts or perpetrators.The ‘welfare’ hook  Agencies The issue: BJP believes key schemes of the Narendra Modi government have reached nearly 22 crore beneficiaries across the country and this will bolster its chances in the general elections. The party had got 17 crore votes in 2014.Significance: The focus is to complete all key schemes by March 2019- 10 lakh toilets, one crore houses under the PM Awas Yojana, electrifying 2.5 crore households under Saubhagya and cover 10 lakh people under Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme. Six crore gas cylinders have already been distributed under Ujjwala.Party line: Har Garib Ko Ghar, Usme Bijli, Cylinder aur Toilet - this seems to be BJP’s campaign line. But Congress has alleged that government makes tall claims on delivery of the schemes and is only chasing numbers.Notebandi, tax & naukri Agencies The issue: While the Modi government has been lauded by some for taking risks and bringing in the Goods and Services Tax, it has drawn flak for demonetisation that adversely affected the GDP. The various slabs under GST and the way it was implemented have also faced flak. The government is also under attack on its promise of two crore jobs a year.Significance: The Opposition has targeted the NDA government on these three issues and its impact did gain some traction in the recent Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.These three issues will be raked up again in the general elections.Party line: BJP still maintains that demonetisation served its purpose of moving India into a digital economy, curbing black money and crippling Naxalism.But now, some that were part of the government till recently, too have openly questioned the rationale behind demonetization.On the GST, PM and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have lately indicated that GST rates of over 95 per cent items may be brought in the 18 per cent slab. Congress has announced it will launch a modified and revamped GST if it is voted to power.On unemployment, BJP claims the government has been able to generate new opportunities both in the organised and unorganised sectors, besides creating several self-employment opportunities.The Opposition has, however, challenged the government over employment data and job growth under.Tug Of war for Dalit votes  Agencies The issue: BJP’s effort to woo Dalits in the last four years has faced challenges due to increasing cases of Dalit atrocities, cow slaughter controversy and the government’s dilly-dallying on the SC/ST Atrocities Act changes as well as the implementation of reservation in promotion.Significance: Dalits and tribals account for big numbers and have a direct bearing on any election outcome. In 2018, the Centre found itself in a tight spot with a March 20 Supreme Court judgement which banned automatic arrests under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. In Madhya Pradesh elections, BJP tried to balance both the upper castes and the Dalits.Party line: Dalits and tribals have traditionally been counted as a Congress vote-bank. However, through concerted educational and social interventions spearheaded by a vast RSS network, BJP has made successful inroads into this block of voters. Over the last three years, both BJP and Congress have been entangled in a vicious political slugfest to appropriate the legacy of Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar.The gender agenda  Agencies The issue: Women have been at the centre of most welfare schemes launched by the Modi government. These include the Swachch Bharat scheme, Ujjwala, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Poshan Abhiyan and Indradhanush for the health of women and children and Jana Dhan Yojana for financial security.On women’s rights, from the #MeToo movement that saw Union minister MJ Akbar losing his position in government to the uproar over the Kathua rape case and the rape and violence against a Dalit girl by a BJP MLA in Uttar Pradesh, the Modi government has found itself cornered on the issue of women safety.Significance: With women being almost half the voter base in the country today, BJP has been consistently working on building a voter base among women. Increasingly women are outnumbering men at casting votes in the elections.The party line: BJP has been consistently projecting itself as trying to improve the quality of life among women and has asked women’s wings of all state units to propagate its schemes at booth level. Congress and the opposition have flagged atrocities against women and failure to bring the Women’s Reservation Bill as government’s lack of sincerity on the issue.BJP introduced the death penalty for crimes of sexual abuse against minors, brought laws to help married women abandoned by NRIs and even made possession and transaction of pornography punishable offences.Rahul Gandhi’s Hindu card  Agencies The issue: Rahul Gandhi’s “temple run” that began with Gujarat elections, intensified during the Karnataka polls. This trend is expected to gain more vigour in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls.Significance: Though Gandhi also visited some mosques, churches and gurudwaras, it was his ‘temple run’ that worked as the TRP booster, inviting the charge of playing the ‘soft Hindutva’ card.The party line: Gandhi’s temple run evoked mixed reactions; BJP became more belligerent, but the Congress strategists are happy and even moved further to make Rahul a janeu dhaari (one who wears the sacred thread). He has now declared his gotra too.Of EVMs & paper trail Agencies The issue: The loser raising issues about credibility of EVMs and VVPATs.Significance: In an era when machine and data manipulation are seen as the biggest possible threat to conduct of free and fair elections, the credibility of India’s upcoming elections depends heavily on the sanctity of the EVMs and VVPATs.The EC has so far fought back political attacks with awareness drives and dialogues with political parties. Recent election results where incumbent governments have been voted out have also helped it find a breather.However, in a Lok Sabha election that is expected to be a hot contest, it is unlikely that attacks against the EVM and VVPAT will abate.The party line: The Opposition parties -largely across party lines- have openly challenged the neutrality of the machines, gone public airing their deep suspicions about machine manipulation, gone to court and issued memorandums on the subject. They have even gone on to demand a return to the ballot paper.To ensure that voter confidence remains intact despite political rhetoric, the EC cannot afford any let up on the EVM or the VVPAT front. That the BJP lost in the recent state polls will be cited as an example EVM efficacy.Talaq to triple talaq  Agencies The issue: After Supreme Court banned the practice of Triple Talaq as violative of fundamental rights, the contentious bill criminalising instant divorce by Muslim men was passed in the Lok Sabha amid a heated debate on December 27.Significance: The Opposition has been opposing the bill saying it was aimed at penalising Muslim men rather than protecting the rights of Muslim women and have sought that it be sent to a select committee for further scrutiny.The party line: BJP claims that the effort is simply to put an end to the misery of Muslim women.Congress has alleged that the bill intends to target the Muslim community.Scam Vs scam Agencies The issue: The government, until the clean chit by the SC, was under serious Opposition fire on the Rafale fighter jet deal.Congress president Rahul Gandhi led the charge with direct allegations of crony capitalism against the prime minister. But the SC order quashing the demand for a probe has come as a shot in the arm for the BJP, which has countered Rafale onslaught by revival of the VVIP chopper scam against the Congress first family through a successful extradition of middleman Christian Michel from Dubai.Besides this, the flight of businessmen Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi and the NPA crisis of the financial sector have also gained traction. Significance: The spate of allegations are targeted denting PM Modi’s image as a spotless administrator who cracks down on corruption, while the BJP riposte aims at the issue closer home to the leadership of ‘dynastic’ parties. The theme of `suit boot ki sarkar’ and ‘chowkidar chor hai’ is aimed at spreading a narrative that the government works for the rich, an important factor in the battle for the mass votes.Party line: The government has fought back through the VVIP chopper probe in which Michel has been allegedly throwing up big names from the UPA. The extradition order from the UK for Mallya has also helped.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:54 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/stage-set-for-general-elections-heres-the-political-box-office/articleshow/67331313.cms
"Trade optimism lifts stocks, but 2018 ends in red","On Monday, the dollar fell to a six-month low against the yen.
","NEW YORK: Equities around the world rose on Monday as possible progress in resolving the trade dispute between the United States and China engendered some investor optimism in what has been a punishing end of year for markets. The US benchmark S&P 500 stock index advanced in light trading volume after US President Donald Trump said he held a ""very good call"" with China's President Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade and said ""big progress"" was being made. Chinese state media were more reserved, saying Xi hoped the negotiating teams could meet each other halfway and reach an agreement that was mutually beneficial. The rise in US equities mirrored that in Asian and European markets, which were also buoyed by trade optimism. Despite Monday's advance, equities ended the year largely in the red, victims of investor anxiety over trade tensions and slowing economic growth. Asian and European shares had been sluggish for much of the year, and in recent months, US stocks followed suit. ""If the European economy continues to decelerate and the Chinese economy decelerates because of tariffs, there is definitely going to be spillover to the United States,"" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. The S&P 500 dropped more than 9 per cent in December, its largest decline since the Great Depression. For the year, the index slid more than 6 per cent, its biggest drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 16 per cent for the year, while the STOXX 600 was more than 13 per cent lower. MSCI's gauge of stocks around the globe fell 11.1 per cent in 2018. A further blow to the Chinese economy could spur a quicker resolution to the US-China trade dispute and thus boost global equities, Saccocia said. Survey data on Monday showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracting for the first time in two years even as the service sector improved. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 265.06 points, or 1.15 per cent, to 23,327.46, the S&P 500 gained 21.11 points, or 0.85 per cent, to 2,506.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 50.76 points, or 0.77 per cent, to 6,635.28. MSCI's emerging markets index rose 0.32 per cent, while the MSCI world stock index gained 0.66 per cent. NO MORE HIKES Yields on US Treasuries fell on Monday, keeping with the trend over the past two months as investors moved to lower-risk investments. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 15/32 in price to yield 2.686 per cent, compared with 2.738 per cent late on Friday. The fall in Treasury yields reflects expectations of a slowdown, if not a pause altogether, in the Federal Reserve's progression of interest-rate hikes. The precipitous drop in yields has undermined the US dollar in recent weeks. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3 per cent and on track to end December with a loss. It is, however, still set for its highest yearly per centage gain since 2015. On Monday, the dollar fell to a six-month low against the yen. The euro was up 0.2 per cent to $1.1459, on track to end the year down nearly 5 per cent against the dollar. Oil posted its first year of losses since 2015, with Brent crude futures down 19.5 per cent and US West Texas Intermediate crude futures down 24.8 per cent. On Monday, Brent crude settled 59 cents higher, or 1.11 per cent, at $53.80 a barrel. US crude settled up 8 cents, or 0.18 per cent, at $45.41 a barrel.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:39 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/trade-optimism-lifts-stocks-but-2018-ends-in-red/articleshow/67331473.cms
Light vehicles keep India on fast track,"The Indian market is estimated to have grown 8.6% to about 4 million units in the year that just went by, automotive forecasting firm IHS Markit said. ","Mumbai: India has kept its position as the fastest growing among the top five markets for light vehicles in 2018, a year when a weak China is predicted to have pulled the global automotive industry into its first recession in a decade.The Indian market is estimated to have grown 8.6% to about 4 million units in the year that just went by, automotive forecasting firm IHS Markit said. Among the other top markets, it expects China and Germany to report a fall in output, and the US and China to post flat numbers.India has held on to the pole position for at least two years now, despite the local market facing an adverse macroeconomic environment of rising finance and insurance cost, and uncertain fuel prices. In 2017, the market had expanded at a marginally slower pace of 8.2%. Light vehicles include cars, utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks.Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for forecasting at IHS Markit, said such sustained strong growth would give confidence to global majors to remain focused to India, especially at a time when they are facing headwinds in other markets. In December, Bloomberg News, citing RBC Capital Markets, reported that the global automotive industry was heading to its first decline in output since 2009. “The inherent structural demand of the Indian market helped vehicle makers overcome multiple challenges right from a spike in tariff, hike in interest rates and rupee depreciation,” Vangaal said.“While the year 2018 was a bumpy year, 2019 presents a different set of challenges,” such as the preparations for the transition to BS-VI emission rules and safety regulations, and uncertainty related to general elections, he added.While the forecast for 2019 is yet to be released, IHS Markit had earlier predicted India to break into the top three markets for light vehicles by 2021, overtaking Japan with sales of about 5 million units.To be sure, the growth in India is slower than in two other BRICS markets, Russia and Brazil, where sales are estimated to have grown 12-14% in 2018. The two markets, though, are much smaller than India in terms of sales volume.N Raja, deputy managing director of Toyota Kirloskar, said growth in GDP and a young demographic would continue to drive motorisation in the coming decades in India. “India can expect the motorisation to further accelerate once the per capita income crosses $5,000, as seen in market like China. Yes, urban markets have seen a slowdown, but rural demand will be the key driving force in the future,” added Raja.In order to tap into this growth opportunity, Toyota Motor had entered into a partnership with Suzuki Motor to have a wider and a deeper presence in the Indian market. The benefits of this partnership will start translating starting 2019 for Japan’s largest car maker Toyota.Ford Motor, which recently stitched a partnership with homegrown utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra, believes India with its young population, growing affluence, economy and infrastructure has the potential to be among the top two automotive markets by 2030.“With a car penetration of 25 per 1,000 people, India clearly is under-penetrated, and has the potential of delivering a 10%-plus CAGR over a 10-year horizon despite short-term headwinds. The future growth in India will also depend on how we as automotive industry respond to changing consumer’s mobility needs in the wake of growing urbanisation and congestion,” said Anurag Mehrotra, managing director of Ford India.While several of the developed economies witnessing growth saturation and emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Mexico facing their unique domestic challenges, India has been the only market delivering sustained growth. To tap into this opportunity, the likes of Kia, Groupe PSA and Shanghai Automotive are entering India in the coming two years, even as existing global automakers are hoping to grab a larger pie of this growing market where Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor together account for twothirds of passenger vehicle sales.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:41 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/light-vehicles-keep-india-on-fast-track/articleshow/67331464.cms
EESL plan to finish first lot of e-cars delayed,"Since only 1,000 cars are delivered so far and as some states are still in the process of finalising their policies for electric vehicles, EESL plans to complete the distribution of the vehicles by Sept 2019.","India’s plan to complete the distribution of the first lot of 10,000 electric cars ordered for government use has been delayed for a second time to September 2019, as only 10% of the order has so far been delivered. Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) floated a global tender in August 2017 for the procurement of electric sedans, to be used by government departments. The order, bagged by Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, was expected to be delivered by June 2018, but was first delayed to March 2019 in the absence of sufficient charging infrastructure for the cars. Since only 1,000 cars are delivered so far and as some states are still in the process of finalising their policies for electric vehicles, EESL plans to complete the distribution of the vehicles by September 2019. “We’ve had to delay the complete rollout to September 2019. Some states are still in the process of finalising their EV policies, because of which the registration of vehicles has not begun,” Saurabh Kumar, managing director at EESL, told ET. EESL had aggregated demand for 20,000 e-cars from Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. “Andhra Pradesh recently announced its EV policy and the registration of vehicles could not begin until the policy was finalised. Gujarat also is working out a plan for rolling out electric vehicles to government departments, and once that is done, roll out will begin,” Kumar added. The Gujarat government’s plan is likely to be along the lines of a recent order issued by the finance ministry, which mandated central government offices to lease only electric vehicles going forward.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/eesl-plan-to-finish-first-lot-of-e-cars-delayed/articleshow/67331483.cms
Tighter scrutiny on the cards for financial conglomerates,,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India has signalled that it might come up with tighter scrutiny of financial conglomerates which run multiple businesses from banks to mutual funds to insurers as it looks to reduce risk in the system after the recent non-banking finance companies’ crisis that threatened to derail economic growth.It said that risk-taking by entrepreneurs and managers in financial services may have to be tempered for better financial stability that is essential for long-term sustained growth.“The recent developments in non-banking financial companies have underscored the need for greater prudence in risk-taking,’’ the RBI said in its Financial Stability Report.“There is, in particular, a need for some rebalancing as excessive credit growth, especially if funded with short-term financing, either sectorally or overall, is not stability-enhancing. The framework for oversight of financial conglomerates also requires closer attention.’’ The default by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. last year roiled the financial markets with lending for NBFCs getting squeezed. Short-term rates jumped and lenders had to sell assets to pay their maturing Commercial Papers since mutual funds declined to roll them over.The aggregate balance sheet size of the NBFC sector increased to Rs 26 lakh crore in September 2018 from Rs 22.2 lakh crore a year earlier as the plentiful availability of funds permitted them to expand. But when the credit markets tightened they had to scramble to avoid defaults.There are 276 systemically important non-deposit accepting NBFCs. All such firms are subjected to prudential regulations such as capital adequacy requirements and provisioning norms along with reporting requirements.There was 5.8 per cent increase in share capital of NBFCs in September 2018 whereas borrowings grew by 17.2 per cent. Loans and advances of the NBFC sector increased by 16.3 per cent and investments increased by 14.1 per cent, it said.

"RBI favours liquidity limit on income, liquid funds",Financial stability report valuation and maturity restrictions for these debt instruments are currently under Sebi review,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has suggested the regulators concerned impose a minimum liquidity limit on fixed-income and liquid fund schemes of mutual funds. The suggestion comes after the IL&FS debt crisis exposed gaps in the mutual fund industry’s approach to valuing fixed-income securities.In its Financial Stability Report, RBI said that the valuation and maturity restrictions for these instruments are under review by Sebi. A mandatory liquidity limit may also be considered by the capital-markets regulator, it said. In this regard, RBI is working on strengthening the asset-liability management guidelines for the non-banking financial (NBFC) sector.NBFCs borrow around 25%-30% of their funds from mutual funds. A report by Credit Suisse had said that mutual fund exposure t o NBFC debt, at 30% of assets under management, is rather outsized and unlikely to sustain. Of this debt, 55% is of short tenor.“The recent episode in the wake of the IL&FS default underlined certain issues…the narrative on which can be broadly divided into nature of credit intermediation of MFs….the price impact of MF dislocation with specific focus on money market rates; fair value of corporate issuances in banks and MFs; and credit concentration in MF portfolios and possible behavioural implications,” RBI said in the report.Mutual funds have about Rs 6,500 crore of IL&FS group exposure out of a total debt of around Rs 90,000 crore. Mutual funds passed the default risk on to investors.IL&FS defaulted on debt obligations in August and September, leading to tight liquidity conditions and increase in funding costs for NBFCs. Asset liability mismatches at other NBFCs got recognised after the IL&FS default came to light. This resulted in redemption pressures.“People have come to release that it carries risk. IL&FS was a grim reminder that mutual funds are subject to riskier markets,” said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research, which is a research publication on Indian mutual funds.The central bank noted that the extant valuation frameworks for corporate bond book appear to be falling short in terms of both benchmarking issues and valuation methods.“A portfolio of corporate bonds that does not reflect the fair and exchangeable value of the underlying assets fails to serve as a barometer for the health of the underlying obligors and can potentially impose externalities on the rest of the market when investors prefer flight to safety as discrepancies in valuations get discovered,” said RBI in its report.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:52 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/mf-news/rbi-favours-liquidity-limit-on-income-liquid-funds/articleshow/67331516.cms

Why self-driving car is still some distance away,The boundless optimism that surrounded driverless cars only a few years ago has been tempered by a slew of challenges.,"In December, Waymo, the leading driverless-car company, brought out the world’s first commercial robo-taxi service. But for now, the service is only available to about 400 test families in suburban Phoenix, and each of its converted Chrysler minivans still has a person at the wheel in case anything goes awry. “It’s a pretty glaring indication that we’re not there yet,” says Matthew Johnson-Roberson, codirector of the University of Michigan’s Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles, who’s working with automakers to develop robot rides.Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet and recently valued at $250 billion by Jefferies Research, declined to comment. In a blog post, chief executive officer John Krafcik said the human safety drivers were at work in Arizona to make riders feel more comfortable. Waymo’s timid rollout is the latest speed bump for a technology touted as certain to save the world from road deaths.As auto and tech giants converge on Las Vegas for the consumer electronics show known as CES, which formally kicks off on Jan 8 and includes a keynote from Krafcik, the seemingly boundless optimism that surrounded driverless cars only a few years ago has been tempered by a slew of persistent technological challenges and big questions about near-term business models, especially as a recession looms. “Most of the automakers are chasing a business model that has yet to be proven — that elusive robo-taxi,” says Craig Giffi, head of consulting firm Deloitte’s US automotive and industrial products practice.At CES, driverless and auto technology will cover 3,00,000 square feet of floor space, more than the total size of many standalone car shows, and the auto industry is continuing to pour billions into self-driving cars.Ford Motor CEO Jim Hackett said in November that the market for autonomous vehicles and other mobility services could reach $10 trillion — half the size of US gross domestic product.","Jan 01, 2019, 08:02 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/cars-uvs/why-self-driving-car-is-still-some-distance-away/articleshow/67331565.cms
"One thing Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos have in common: They both do the dishes every night",Here’s how doing mindless tasks are better for the top bosses - and you - in the long run.,"Author Alexandra Stoddard said, “Puttering is really a time to be alone, to dream, to get in touch with yourself. To putter is to discover.” It’s a sentiment that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos couldn’t agree with more.During a recent interview at the Economic Club of Washington, Bezos emphasised the importance of carving out time to just ‘putter’. “My puttering time is very important to me,” he told David Rubenstein, the billionaire founder of Carlyle Group. “I go to bed early, I get up early. So, I like to putter in the morning. I like to read the newspaper. I like to have coffee. I like to have breakfast with my kids before they go to school.”A slower start in the mornings is a family tradition Bezos adopted years ago. “I wanted her [his wife, MacKenzie] to get the best hours of my day,” he told The Wall Street Journal in 1999. From Jeff Bezos To Tony Fernandes, Interesting Fantasies Of The Top BossesAutoplay1 of 3Billionaire DreamlandJeff Bezos may be minting billions, but he fantasises about being a bartender and making craft cocktails.A look at some fantasies — achieved or otherwise — of other big guns in the business world.Role PlaySteve JobsThe late Apple co-founder fantasised about celebrating the sale of the millionth iMac by recreating the Willy Wonka golden certificate contest, author Ken Segall wrote in a book about Apple. Jobs even wanted to dress up like Willy Wonka — the top hat, velvet blazer and bow tie included. He took that fantasy to the grave since California's law required competitions to allow entry without requiring a purchase. Pity. Jobs would have looked cool in a purple suit.Bound In BooksTony FernandesThe AirAsia founder shared that it was his dream to see a book about him written. The Malaysia-based businessman said, ""To hear kids saying I have inspired them. It's a nice feeling… Dreaming is good. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't dream."" Looks like Fernandes took care of his fantasy himself — his autobiography was released early last month. The airline entrepreneur also said that starting a no-frills airline was also one of his dreams that became a reality and paved the way for other fantasies to be achieved. Taking it slowSeveral independent studies have found that a slower start to the day can actually boost your productivity and your energy. By ‘puttering around’ in the morning, you find you have more time to connect with your loved ones, cook a healthier breakfast, boost your spirits and set you up for a more productive day.In a 2014 interview, Bezos said, “We all have a limited amount of time, and where you spend it and how you spend it is just an incredibly levered way to think about the world. Where you spend your time and energy is one of the most important decisions you get to make in life.”Dishing it up In the same interview, Bezos shared that he washed the dishes every night to please his wife. “I can see that [doing the dishes] actually makes her like me. It’s a very odd thing. I’m pretty convinced it ’s the sexiest thing I do.” CEO Summer Camp: Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, Satya Nadella Take Sun Valley By StormAutoplay1 of 1Taking Over IdahoIt’s that time of the year – Sun Valley, or what’s popularly known as ‘summer camp for billionaires’. The mogul fest takes place at the lavish 3,000 acre Sun Valley Resort at Idaho. While it converts into a ski resort in winter, during the summer, guests can take part in golfing, cycling and white water rafting. The billionaires are spoilt for choice – there are also signature massages at the destination spa, indoor bowling lanes in the basement and a man-made ice skating rink.  While neither Bezos nor his wife have elaborated on why he does it, past studies have shown that doing the dishes can reduce stress and boost creativity. A University of California study found that doing mindless tasks allowed the brain to wander and engage in creative problem-solving.Another study by Florida State University found that concentrating on the feel of the warm water or the smell of the soap stimulated the brain and decreased stress levels. And it seems Bezos is not alone in offering a helping hand. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates once told a Reddit forum, “I do the dishes every night — other people volunteer, but I like the way I do it.”In a world where some CEOs brag about working 80-hour weeks, perhaps Bezos has the right idea. “I live my life in such a way that — in a quiet moment of reflection and I’m thinking back on my life — I have as few regrets as possible,” he told Rubenstein. Biz Tycoons - Like Ryan & Jared Smith - Who Made Billions From ScratchAutoplay1 of 6Billion Dollar DreamRyan (L) and Jared Smith became the tech world’s newest billionaires after selling their company, Qualtrics International, which they started from their parents’ basement in Utah, for $8 billion. Here are other businessmen who started underground and then worked their way to the top.Lessons From The PastBefore he was a business magnate and owner of the Virgin Group, Richard Branson was the founder of a youth-culture magazine. As a 16-year-old, Branson started Student Magazine from the basement of his parents’ house in 1966. He would interview and feature prominent personalities, including Mick Jagger. The billionaire entrepreneur credits the magazine — and the lessons it taught him — for helping him establish Virgin Records and his business empire.Swimming With The SharksBusinessman Kevin O’Leary started SoftKey Software Products, which was later renamed The Learning Company, in his Toronto basement in 1986, with an investment of $10,000 from his mother. He grew the company into a huge operation and even moved it to Boston. In 1999, toy giant Mattel acquired the company for $4.2 billion. Tycoon TalesAmerican hip-hop apparel company FUBU was founded by Daymond John, along with J Alexander Martin, Keith Perrin and Carlton Brown, in his basement in 1992. It is reported that John mortgaged his house for $100,000 and invested that money into his company. In 1995, Samsung invested in FUBU. In addition to being a businessman, John is also a motivational speaker, author and a television personality.Saying No	In 2001, Carl Rodrigues shut himself away in his basement in the Canadian city of Mississauga to come up with a business idea he would enjoy working on. After a month of working “crazy hours”, Rodrigues came up with the idea of a software system that allowed users to control their mobile phone from their laptops. He named his company SOTI. Despite being hugely successful, Rodrigues turned down many takeover bids, including one from Microsoft. The company, which was valued at $1 billion last year, remains completely owned by Rodrigues and his wife.

"With increasing spotlight, life is much harder for central banks",,"By Mohamed A EL-ErianRisk shunners won and thumbed their noses at equity investors in 2018. The Public Provident Fund (PPF), the one true friend of many middleclass Indians, regained its pole position this year with an annual post-tax return of 7.7 per cent.For reasons largely outside its control, the Federal Reserve is now being widely blamed for fueling financial market instability and risking derailment of the U.S. economy. This is quite a contrast from just a few month ago, when it was still being feted by many for its role as an active and effective repressor of financial market volatility. It is probably only a matter of time until the European Central Bank finds itself in a similar, perhaps tougher position. The reality is both central banks have entered a new, more uncertain phase that is likely to last for some time, requiring more skillful policy navigation and communication, and some operational changes.Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Central Bank of India Ltd  moved down by 1 in a month on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »Coming out of the 2008 global financial crisis, central banks went out of their way to boost asset prices as a means of supporting the economy. They suppressed volatility by driving down interest rates; buying huge amounts of debt securities and housing them securely on their balance sheets; and, when a bout of volatility occurred, being quick to reassure markets of their broad and consistent support.This unprecedented phase of central banking had its natural limits. As detailed in my 2016 book, 1 the benefits of buying time for the economy to heal came with costs and unintended consequences. Accordingly, when the conditions to normalize policy arose, the Fed pivoted by stopping its asset-purchase program, hiking interest rates nine times and slowly reducing its balance sheet. The ECB followed with a considerable lag. After tapering its asset purchase program during the past few months, it will halt it at the end of this year and may start raising rates during the summer.But what started out as a relatively smooth and orderly process has become more problematic -- especially for the Fed, which is being accused of fueling financial volatility and risking the country’s economic well-being.Stock markets are experiencing wild intraday swings, while falling prices have delivered one of the worse Decembers ever for equities. With that, the measure of household consumer sentiment reported last week came in below consensus forecasts, at the same time that consumer confidence expectations also tumbled.Yet much of the volatility of recent weeks is due to factors outside the Fed’s control. They include:A slower global expansion as both Europe and China struggle to implement of progrowth policies; Other economic concerns, from the partial shutdown of the federal government to trade policy as markets wait to see which concessions China will offer the US to end the trade war between the two countries;Asset prices that, for years, were decoupled from fundamentals amid ample and predictable liquidity; and The proliferation of passive investing, computer trading and exchange-traded funds, including some that promised liquidity in inherently less liquid asset classes, potentially amplifying the risk of contagion both on the way up and on the way down.It is only a matter of time until the spot light also shines on the ECB. Because its normalisation process is now focused on balance-sheet policy rather than the more visible interest-rate moves, it hasn’t yet attracted the same attention as the Fed. Yet this process faces many more questions on account of the slow growth in the euro zone, some weaknesses in the region’s banking system, pockets of excessive indebtedness and political gridlock that limits needed structural and fiscal reforms.Against that backdrop, the risk has risen that volatility could undermine the global economy, and that some investors may lose confidence in the orderly functioning of financial markets. Naturally, this is obscuring the benefits of a long-due transition to a less distorted financial regime that, otherwise, would have threatened much larger economic damage down the road.There is no easy way out of this situation. Indeed, the spotlight will shine even more brightly on the Fed next year. This will become most apparent at the news conferences, now to be held after each Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where Chairman Jerome Powell is asked to opine on inherently tricky and uncertain policy decisions, options and outlooks.Whichever way you look at it, central banks will be exposed to more criticism from politicians, market participants and analysts. Having said that, there are a few things they could do. For example, in the case of the Fed, consideration could be given to the following steps, including in the context of the review of communications practices that Powell has already launched: Conveying more consistently and credibly that policy makers are sensitive to the risk of spillbacks from a weakening global economy and market disruptions; signaling the possibility that the automatic pilot governing its balance-sheet reduction is subject to review; and phasing out the blue dot plot that shows policy makers’ individual expectations for future rate increase in favor of communications that portray the range of possible outcomes. This might be more along the lines of what the Bank of England does with its quarterly inflation report.These steps will not take the Fed out of the firing line. Yet they can play a role in lowering the risks of a policy mistake or market accident.

"Samir Modi on the surname game, & why his father didn't want him to start Colorbar","As a youngster, Colorbar founder Samir Modi grappled with his famous last name. ","A famous surname has it benefits. But it has its share of trouble. The pressures that come from being associated with a famous last name are real, according to Colorbar founder Samir Modi.His father, KK Modi, is a prominent name in the Indian business community and his brother Lalit, the former IPL chief who was dogged by a range of allegations, is also a household name.During an earlier interaction with ETPanache, Modi shared that his last name opened some doors for him. But it still wasn’t easy. “All through my school life, I wondered if someone is my friend because I’m a Modi or because he’s [genuinely] my friend,” he said. AgenciesKK Modi is a prominent name in the Indian business community. And then, there are the constant comparisons. “When you join the workforce, you are compared with the management, with your sibling, chacha, mama, tau, everybody. It doesn’t matter that you may have just started, and they had 30 years of experience. All your life you’ll have that sword dangling on your head,” Modi said.Add to that equation, a tough father. The story in his words goes that when he was launching Colorbar, Modi’s father walked into the room and said to him: “I don’t think you should launch Colorbar.” Of course, the son went ahead with the launch. AgenciesLalit Modi, the former IPL chief, was dogged by a range of allegations. But has the father changed his mind since? “He is a tough man. I don’t think he says that he is wrong. I think he says, mein woh nahi karta toh yeh nahi hota [If I hadn’t done that, this wouldn’t have happened]. I’m sure he is very proud of me but, at the same time, he is a difficult man to please. My father feels that I’m still a learner and I agree with him. He is not an easy cookie,” Modi said. Hinduja Vs Hinduja; Ambani Brothers In Arms, And Other Family Feuds Of India IncAutoplay1 of 11It's NOT All In The FamilyConventional wisdom dictates that family, almost always, comes first. But India Inc has shown that conventional wisdom doesn't always hold true. Over the years, a number of prominent business families have faced separation woes. And many have had to take some hard calls.The Ambani vs Ambani saga that captured the country's imagination in 2004, and gave birth to various kinds of theories, saw rapprochement (of sorts) last year when elder brother Mukesh bailed out younger sibling Anil by paying Rs 453 crore dues in the Ericsson case, and thereby preventing the latter from being jailed.And while the Ambanis have done course-correction, family ties seem to be shaking at the Hinduja household. The brothers, who run the $11.2 billion conglomerate, are not seeing eye to eye over the Switzerland-based Hinduja Bank. The disagreements have left the family's patriarch SP Hinduja and his daughters on one side, and the other three brothers - Ashok, Gopichand and Prakash on the other.In Pic: Hinduja Brothers (L), Mukesh and Anil Ambani (R).Falling ApartThe once closely-knit Hinduja brothers have become the latest business family to find themselves in the middle of a tussle over the future of their $11.2 billion fortune. Fissures have emerged among the four brothers, one of the world's richest, over a letter signed by them in 2014. According to the document, the assets held by one brother belong to all, and that each man will appoint the others as their executors.However, the group's patriarch 84-year-old Srichand Hinduja and his daughter, Vinoo, want the letter declared worthless.The dispute came to a light in a ruling delivered by a London judge, who said that the three other brothers, Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok, tried to use the letter to take control of Hinduja Bank - an asset that was in Srichand’s sole name.The court also allowed Vinoo, SP’s younger daughter, to act as his ‘litigation friend’ to safeguard his interests, since he is said to be suffering from a form of dementia.The ongoing litigation in the London court began in November last year. Vinoo is seeking to have the July 2014 agreement declared null and void.Not All Good At The GodrejsThe 122-year-old $5-billion Godrej group seems to be the latest India Inc family to have been hit by an internal feud after differences cropped up among family members over development of land holdings owned by Godrej & Boyce.Brothers Adi and Nadir Godrej control the group’s three listed companies — Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), Godrej Properties and Godrej Agrovet. Godrej & Boyce, the holding company of the group with business divisions including aerospace, consumer, office and industrial products, furniture and appliances, is owned by all family members with Jamshyd Godrej as its chairman.The dispute reportedly arose after the family members were split over the development of a 1,000-acre land parcel they own in Mumbai. According to reports, the crux of the issue is the concentration of the family’s land holding in Godrej & Boyce and its commercial exploitation by the group’s listed arm Godrej Properties.While Adi and Nadir are in favour of development of the land, the Jamshyd Godrej side is believed to be against excessive development.JM Financial chairman Nimesh Kampani and lawyer Zia Mody are advising Jamshyd Godrej, while Kotak Mahindra Bank CEO Uday Kotak and Cyril Shroff of legal firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas are assisting Adi and Nadir Godrej untangle the situation.The family business board is led by group chairman Adi Godrej and includes brother Nadir, cousin Jamshyd and brother-in-law Vijay Crishna. The fourth generation of the family, which includes the children of Adi, Jamshyd, Nadir and Crishna who are past 18 years, attend meetings as invitees.In Pic: (L-R) Adi, Nadir and Jamshyd Godrej inaugurate the 'Godrej Interio' store, a joint venture between Godrej & Boyce's Jamshyd Godrej and designer Krsna Mehta, at Godrej Bhawan in Mumbai on February 24, 2010. The Tale Of Two Brothers	The Ambani war was no silent affair. From defamation suits, letters to the PM to dragging each other to court, the once-close brothers did it all.		India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani and his brother Anil Ambani's bitter feud began soon after the death of their father Dhirubhai Ambani, the founder of Reliance Industries, in 2002.		Ambani Sr. hadn't left a will, so his elder son Mukesh became Chairman and MD of Reliance Industries Ltd while Anil was Vice-Chairman.		The feud for control led to the split of the Reliance Group. However, in 2005, their mother, Anandiben, brokered a de-merger, giving Mukesh control of oil and gas, petrochemicals, refining and manufacturing, while Anil got electricity, telecoms and financial services.		Even though some shareholders opposed the decision, the Bombay High Court had approved the de-merger.		But that didn't settle things. Rather the oil wars continued between the brothers, with Anil even accusing involvement of the Government in supporting Mukesh.		Anil's Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. had even placed newspaper ads alleging that the Indian government had sided with Mukesh's Reliance Industries.And It Continued Till 2019 ...	Things only went from bad to worse for the brother. In 2008, Anil filed a $2.12 billion defamation suit against Mukesh for remarks he made during an interview with The New York Times.	What started off as a family feud, was termed a matter of 'national interest' by India's then-finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who requested the brothers to resolve the dispute privately.		After going to the Supreme Court in 2009 over the gas dispute (the court ruled in Mukesh's favour), Kokilaben once again intervened in May 2010 to broker a peace agreement. Officials of both their companies received notes that said the Ambani brothers would draft a non-compete agreement.		Soon after, Anil withdrew his defamation suit.		Now a few years later, the brothers are often seen together at family functions, and other events.

Classic is the new cool: Millennials now prefer small & discerning wrist watches,Vintage and classic watches are enjoying a revival. ,"Most men wear large watches. This is because they want their timepieces to make a statement. But in their hearts, the discerning know that nothing looks better on a wrist than a small classic watch. That means an analog watch (with hands) on a dial of around 36mm and with a leather strap.I speak from experience. A couple of years ago, I bought an HMT Jubilee for the grand sum of Rs 2,000. I got it more as a collectible. But with time I realised how nice it looked, and started wearing it regularly. No watch has suited me better. It is a hand winding mechanical watch and if you want to shut the world out, you may press your ear against your wrist and savour the satisfying ticking sound of the tireless HMT heart.Vintage and classic watches are enjoying a revival. In fact, they are one of the key categories for a product with an uncertain place in today’s world. Nobody needs a watch to tell time. But equally true is that most people like watches as lifestyle products or investments. Secondly, however techie the world may be getting, classic style continues to be attractive.

Some recent developments in the watch world prove the popularity of traditional watches, even among the young. This year, Tom Ford made his debut in the industry with a classic rectangular model. And two analog watch brands started by millennials for millennials —MVMT and Olivia Burton — made headlines. Both made a cultural and business impact and were acquired by watch giant Movado, whose chairman Efraim Grinberg is a desk-thumping proponent of old-world timepieces.Talking about the thinking behind his watch, Ford said in an interview, “In general I dislike a trendy watch, as I’m a fairly classic person. For a man who is more traditional, watches are really one of the few accessories he can wear outside of maybe a wedding ring.” And as seen by the success of millennial brands, even non-traditional people gravitate towards retro watches. MVMT, pronounced ‘Movement’, was started in 2013 by two 20-somethings in Los Angeles — Jake Kassan and Kramer LaPlante. Olivia Burton, a women’s brand from the UK, was started in 2012 by two women who were barely 30 — Jemma Fennings and Lesa Bennet. According to watch portal Hodinkee, Movado bought MVMT for about $200 million and Olivia Burton for $79 million.Grinberg, the Movado chairman, said, “Our research with millennials shows a high level of interest in traditional watches. These two brands (MVMT and Olivia Burton) proved our hypothesis that people weren’t going to just wear wearables and connected timepieces.” Much-mocked hipsters have also galvanised the classic market with their love for vintage. Websites like Etsy offer some great bargains on old watches. And for those not short of money, there is Tom Ford, Cartier and an entire universe of understated beauty.","Jan 01, 2019, 08:09 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/classic-is-the-new-cool-millennials-now-prefer-small-discerning-wrist-watches/articleshow/67324676.cms

"Harlequin Head, Landscape with Horses: Five notable art forgeries from around the world","In June 2011, news of a massive art fraud by a German group of forgers came to light.","             Recently, Picasso’s ‘Harlequin Head’ was believed to have been stashed away in a Romanian forest. However, the work was reportedly that of forger Geert Jan Jansen. A look at other most notable art forgeries.Comedy of errorsIn June 2011, news of a massive art fraud by a German group of forgers came to light. This news affected a number of collectors including comedian Steve Martin who had bought Heinrich Campendonk’s ‘Landscape with Horses’ for about $850,000 in 2004. It turned out to be a fake. It was only after he sold the painting in 2006 at a loss of over $200,000 that the painting’s falsity was revealed. The German forgers, led by Wolfgang Beltracchi and his accomplice Otto Schulte-Kellinghaus, are accused of selling over 44 forged artworks over 10 years. In 2010, Beltracchi was arrested and spent three years in prison.Under the hatIn 2010, a West Hollywood antiques dealer, Tatiana Khan, was arrested for selling a phony Picasso for $2 million. Prosecutors alleged that Khan paid an art restorer $1,000 to duplicate ‘The Woman in the Blue Hat’, which is a 1902 pastel of Picasso. The FBI stepped in after the buyer had the work examined and learnt that it was a fake. Khan eventually agreed to plead guilty to federal fraud charges. AgenciesThe Woman in the Blue Hat Abstract formIn 2009, New York’s Knoedler Gallery’s chairman Ann Freedman resigned after a pair of collectors were sold a fake Mark Rothko for $8.3 million. Upon investigation, it was revealed that under Freedman’s reign from 1994 to 2011, the gallery sold numerous fakes of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Robert Motherwell. The fakes were made by forger Pei-Shen Qian in his garage in Queens and were sold to the gallery by Glafira Rosales. In 2011, the gallery closed permanently. Rosales pleaded guilty on many charges and Quian avoided prosecution by fleeing to China. AgenciesA painting sold by Knoedler as a Mark Rothko that turned out to be fake A master forgerIt has been called the biggest art scandal of the century. In 2016, a number of forgeries in the Old Master style of paintings were uncovered. The collective value of money spent on the fakes is reportedly $255 million. At the centre of the scandal is French dealer Giuliano Ruffini. The bulk of the paintings, which are reportedly fakes of the work of Frans Hals, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Orazio Gentileschi, and other artists, are from the late French civil engineer André Borie’s collection. Sotheby’s refunded $10 million to the buyer of a Frans Hals painting.

Check out these abstracts which sold for a fortune thanks to their minimalistic allure.Untitled (1970) by Cy TwomblyCost: $70.5 millionWhat seems like chalk scribbles on a slate is actually an oil-based house paint and crayon artwork on canvas by Edwin Parker ‘Cy’ Twombly Jr, which fetched a record price for the artist in Christie’s 2014 sale. Part of Twombly’s ‘blackboard’ paintings, the 1970 artwork is inspired by his stint in Pentagon as a cryptologist. What’s interesting is the way he produced this artwork. He sat on the shoulders of a friend, who kept on walking along the length of the canvas, enabling Twombly to create fluid lines. The painting’s then owner, Audrey Irmas, a philanthropist, parted with the painting to raise funds for her foundation for social justice. Interestingly, Irmas bought the painting for $3.85 million in 1990.

Yet, the painting was sold below the low presale estimate of $15 million. Turns out, Fontana was inspired to paint this artwork watching Red Desert, a 1964 movie created by Michelangelo Antonioni, which won the Golden Lion in that year’s Venice Film Festival. In fact, the inscription on the back of the painting, in Italian, reads, “I returned yesterday from Venice, I saw Antonioni’s film!!!”(Image: www.sothebys.com) Real confusionIn 2016, Korean minimalist painter Lee Ufan deemed 13 of his alleged forged paintings to be the real deal, despite a South Korean art dealer’s confession to forging them. “An artist can recognise his own piece at a glance,” Ufan said, after authenticating the alleged fakes. The police issued a statement saying that while they respected the artist’s opinion, the paintings were still under investigation as the claims of authenticity were in conflict with forensic evidence.

Therefore, we create one here. We look at the horoscopes of a few prominent political leaders who share their birthdates with each sign of the zodiac. The zodiac signs followed here are those according to the western style. They are assigned corresponding to the dates of birth of the leaders mentioned here. We hasten to add, the predictions have no scientific or astrological significance, and are meant to be a work of imagination and humour only.Have fun.

"As aluminium prices fall, fate of local companies hinges on tariff buffer",,"ET Intelligence Group: The earnings outlook for local aluminium producers, including Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco, now hinges on the increase in the import duty on the metal as global prices are at a 20-month low.Current LME aluminium prices are at $1,850 per tonne, much lower than what analysts had estimated. Earnings estimates were largely made with $1,940 a tonne as the price benchmark. The recent fall in metal prices could lead to a sharp earnings downgrade unless there is an increase in import duty.Union minister Suresh Prabhu recently said that there is a proposal from the industry to raise the duty on imports and the commerce ministry is in favour of it. Around 1.4 million tonnes (MT) of aluminium, or 40 per cent of total domestic demand, was imported in 2017.The local aluminium industry, which has been seeking protection against rising imports, has proposed an increase in levies on scrap and primary aluminium from 2.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, to 10 per cent.A likely increase in import duties may offer some support, but the outlook will continue to remain weak, given the falling aluminium prices globally. The steep fall in aluminium prices shows the weakness in demand, especially from the slowing global automotive sales. From the peak in April, aluminium prices have fallen 28 per cent.Average global cost of aluminium production is estimated around $1,750 to $1,800 per tonne, given the elevated alumina and coal costs. Indian players such as Hindalco and Nalco are fully backward integrated and hence may not get into losses if aluminium has to fall further.  Vedanta, not being fully integrated, will be more affected. For Vedanta, in the latest quarter, aluminium contributed 17 per cent to total earnings, and zinc 50 per cent, while oil largely made up the rest. The decline in oil prices would also affect the total earnings.At average LME aluminium price of $2,087 a tonne in the September quarter, Vedanta’s operating margin was 10 per cent, Hindalco’s 19 per cent and Nalco’s 27 per cent. Nalco, a net alumina long player, benefitted from higher alumina prices. Despite the sharp correction in the commodity prices, shares of these companies have largely remained firm.

HR resolutions: Skilling staff and technological advancement key focus areas for companies,"As India Inc steps into the New Year, staying in step with rapid technological changes and skilling of staff are key focus areas for companies, as are driving diversity and dealing more effectively with a millennial workforce.","As India Inc steps into the New Year, staying in step with rapid technological changes and skilling of staff are key focus areas for companies, as are driving diversity and dealing more effectively with a millennial workforce. Human resources heads of leading companies across sectors weigh in on the top HR trends for 2019. Sreeradha D Basu & Rica Bhattacharyya report.Reskill, re-learn   Krishnamurthy ShankarGroup head of HRD at InfosysFocus on agility: Large IT services companies have pursued a templated framework to drive learning and career growth. However, technology can bring in customised and personalised learning options for individuals and get people to learn continuously. There will be a greater focus on flexible career development options.More than 80% of organisations have some form of structured learning and development programme, said Mettl’s State of Workplace Learning and Development Report 2018.Rebooting rewards: A movement towards greater agile development will also lead to more agile performance management by integrating real-time data and crowdsourced inputs from the team.In rewards, we will see a greater focus on key skills, specialist and high-performing talent, and on longer-term retention levers such as benefits and stock plans.Millennial perspective  Agencies Phanindranath Kakarla Head-HR, Edelweiss GroupFocus on right leadership: In India, the critical need for organisations to make sure that they have the right leadership will never change. Going forward, this will even more be a high priority for companies and will further increase because of the sheer pace of growth in the country.Relook at things from the millennial perspective: Millennials in the workforce will force all of us to relook at things in traditional human resources such as compensation, development, team formation, etc. We have to find out ways to keep up with the change and be at the forefront of managing the expectations of the millennial workforce.43% of millennials envision leaving their jobs within two years; only 28% seek to stay beyond five years, according to Deloitte India Millennial Survey 2018. Unmesh PawarHead–people, performance & culture at KPMG in IndiaHumanised organisation: With technology disruptions, expect employees to consistently stay relevant on the skill curve. The technologies to help people collaborate are helping people stay connected but also isolating them from real connection. HR teams will have to figure out how they make employee well-being a priority and ensure their employees are at peak energies physically and mentally, and their hearts are truly engaged.Enhancing candidate experience: 2019 should see CHROs looking at their talent acquisition strategy more closely to enhance candidate experience. This means actively investing in strengthening their employer brand digitally to ensure the value proposition stands out to their prospective talent pools. Virtual, AR, chatbots and application self-selection tools will all help create a highly personalised candidate experience.Employers in India expect workplace automation to increase to 27% from 14% in three years, higher than global and APAC average, as per Wills Towers Watson Global Future of Work Survey.Data to drive decisions  Agencies Sahil MathurGlobal head of human resources and culture, InMobiMake data talk: Being engaged and leading intelligently with predictive and prospective analytics, rather than lagging and reacting, will be the key change in HR. Maths, quantitative analysis, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence will be used across years of employee data to make strong suggestions. This data will talk only if a company is able to rejig it and extrapolate information to suit the current context.Movement towards a gig economy: The workforce will move into a gig-engagement structure. Employees will be looking for shorter stints with cross-functional learning on their own time-terms. There will no longer be a restricted 9-5 long-term construct. Factor in changing expectations and therefore innovative well-being mechanisms to make employees know that the company cares and that the employees matter.Less is more: There are too many things on the long list of things to be done by HR. Prioritise ruthlessly and stay close to the most urgent business, people strategy and issues. Everything else can be managed through automation or through enabling tools.39% of surveyed candidates and hiring managers in India favour freelance roles, found Kelly Services survey ‘Gig Economy: How Free Agents are Redefining Work’Diversity, inclusion buzzwords  Agencies TN Hari Head-HR, BigBasketGetting HR a seat at the table: Since HR emerged as a separate function, one of the things it has grappled with is how to get a seat at the table. HR has been seen as a function that keeps the kitchen clean and rarely recognised as one that makes a strategic contribution.HR has rarely been the first choice for the best and brightest when it came to either education or career choices.And HR has never been a deep discipline calling for a rigorous study unlike, say, medicine, engineering or law.Driving diversity and inclusion: Companies will also be more thoughtful about enhancing diversity and inclusion as well as creating safe and secure workplaces for women. The #MeToo campaigns in the closing of months of 2018 will accelerate this in 2019.A survey of Indian and multinational companies by ProEve showed that the share of women in middle management is 17%, in senior management 14% and further down to 12% at the top level.","Jan 01, 2019, 04:07 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/hr-resolutions-skilling-staff-and-technological-advancement-key-focus-areas-for-companies/articleshow/67331507.cms
Dollar ends strongest year since 2015 on defensive note,"Dollar, which tracks the greenback versus six peers, was down 0.22 per cent on Monday.","NEW YORK: The dollar fell against the yen and euro in thin year-end trading on Monday as optimism about progress in the US-China trade dispute hurt its safe-haven allure, but the greenback stayed on track to log its strongest annual performance in three years. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus six peers, was down 0.22 per cent on Monday. ""The US dollar is heading into the end of the calendar year on the defensive as global stocks - bearing in mind that some markets are done for the year already - perk up following positive comments on US-China trade from President Trump,"" Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said in a note. Equities around the world rose on Monday as hints of progress on the Sino-US trade standoff provided optimism in what has been a punishing end of year for markets globally. Risk sentiment brightened slightly when US President Donald Trump said he held a ""very good call"" with China's President Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade and claimed ""big progress"" was being made. The two nations have engaged in a trade war for much of 2018, shaking world financial markets as punitive tariffs disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two largest economies. The yen which tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation, remained in demand and the greenback hit a fresh six-month low against the Japanese currency. ""We've heard this all before and are still awaiting concrete details, of course,"" said Osborne. The persistent tensions have boosted safe-haven demand for the greenback this year as investors bet that the United States is in better shape than its rivals to weather a trade war. For the year, the index was up 4.4 per cent, its best yearly per centage gain since 2015. While the dollar has been relatively stable going into the end of 2018, expensive valuation, a flagging equity boom, waning cash repatriation by US companies, and the possibility that the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates as many times as previously signaled pose a challenge for the greenback. ""We still rather think the US dollar may be peaking after spending much of the past year on the offense,"" said Osborne. On Monday, the euro EBS was 0.08 per cent higher against the greenback. Although the single currency has gained versus the dollar in recent weeks, economic growth and inflation in Europe remain much weaker than the European Central Bank's expectations. The euro is set to lose nearly 5 per cent versus the dollar in 2018. Sterling, which has been battered this year by Brexit woes, rose 0.31 per cent to a three-week high. The British pound has lost about 6 per cent of its value versus the dollar this year.","Jan 01, 2019, 08:32 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/forex/dollar-ends-strongest-year-since-2015-on-defensive-note/articleshow/67331818.cms

"MSP hike for copra not to hurt Marico, say analysts",,"The increase in minimum support price (MSP) for copra by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for 2019 will not have any major impact on Marico’s margins as the current market price of copra is still above the MSP, said analysts.The CCEA hiked the MSP of copra by Rs 2,010 per quintal to Rs 9,521 per quintal for 2019 season, an increase of 27 per cent. However, the domestic copra prices are currently trading at about Rs 10,500 per quintal, which is much higher than the MSP of copra.“The increase in MSP will not have any material impact on the earnings of Marico in the near term” said Kaustubh Pawaskar, research analyst, Sharekhan. “Having said that the increase in the MSP will keep the prices hovering above Rs 10,000 per quintal in the near-to-medium term.”Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Marico Ltd  moved up by 1 in a month on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »Historically, it is observed that the market prices of copra do not have correlation with the MSP as government procurement is minimal compared to domestic consumption. The copra cycle peaked out during the beginning of 2018 and now the prices are continuously declining, analysts said. Currently, copra prices are down 35 per cent from its peak levels.Copra contributes 40 per cent to Marico’s domestic raw material costs. Increase in copra prices in 2017 led to 365bps decline in operating margin before tax (EBITDA) from 19.7 per cent in Q4FY17 to 16.0 per cent in Q2FY19.“We do not see negative impact of increase in copra MSP on Marico’s profitability as the actual procurement price and MSP do not have correlation” Nikhat Koor, associateconsumer, Dolat Capital.Marico’s stock has rallied over 18 per cent post September quarter results. The stock declined 1 per cent to Rs 375 on Monday. Marico remains one of analysts’ top pick in the FMCG basket.“Three factors reinforce our confidence in Marico’s earnings prospects; likely benign raw material environment over the next 18-24 months, strong performance of Parachute volumes in recent quarters and healthy growth prospects in the VAHO segment, ” said Krishnan Sambamoorthy, FMCG analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

He said that India allows only the top 200 globally ranked universities to collaborate with Indian universities.However, the top 500 universities should be allowed, as some of the individual courses in the top 500 universities could be topranking, he said. “UK universities are keen to attract more Indians to come and study in the UK,” said McCole. “(They) also want to work with Indian education institutes, both private and public.”A delegation of UK universities visited India in October and November and held discussions with academics and corporate bodies in this regard, he said. It visited the University of Mumbai and the Indian School of Design of Innovation in Mumbai to discuss collaborative research, he said. It also held round-table discussions with Indian companies from banking, oil and gas, manufacturing, engineering, and food and beverages sectors for collaborative research.McCole said representatives of Indian companies had said that Indian graduates lacked the most in soft skills such as creativity. “This is an area where the UK is very strong,” he said.

Taking a break? A co-working space has introduced a ‘frustration zone’,"Hora, a startup co-founder, says it helps him leave his frustration at office. Plus, it’s fun. Even his company’s interns go in there regularly. “They come out looking happy, and we don’t ask questions either.”","New Delhi: On a difficult day at work, 30-year-old Warpreet Hora swings a hammer at a keyboard or two.He does this at the ‘frustration zone’ at the Gurgaon centre of GoWork, a co-working company. It is a soundproof room littered with old computers, laptops, punching bags and skeletons of old cars, along with several plastic hammers.Hora, a startup co-founder, says it helps him leave his frustration at office. Plus, it’s fun. Even his company’s interns go in there regularly. “They come out looking happy, and we don’t ask questions either.”GoWork’s chief evangelist Sudeep Singh introduced the ‘frustration zone’ to help millennials— these 20-35-year-olds make up 90-95% of those sharing the coworking space—ease stress.They’re the generation who have grown up with rapid changes in technology, and a high degree of comfort in their lives, he says. “I’ve heard of companies losing millennial employees because their coffee was bad.”So, will a facility like the ‘frustration zone’ really help ease stress? Views are mixed.Seema Hingorrany, a Mumbaibased clinical psychologist, sees this never-satisfied attitude mirrored among her patients too, and attributes it to a fast-paced lifestyle.""Breaking things could be a temporary release,” she says, adding: “But it won’t work for people with serious mental conflicts.” It doesn’t address the root cause of the frustration either.“It sounds like fun, but I don’t think it will help too much,” says Amit Sharma, 28, an engineer at an ecommerce company. “I would prefer playing a game of football or having a go on an X-Box.”Breaking things might be a way for people to indulge their animal spirit in a safe way, says Lohit Bhatia, CEO of staffing at Ikya Human Capital Solutions. “Why do people do kickboxing or martial arts? It’s a non-destructive and non-criminal way of spending energy.”Exposure to the best practices across the world is a factor that is driving companies to do more to keep their employees happy, he says. “The first 15 years after liberalisation was all about maximising profits, but now people realise that a happy workforce is a committed workforce.”Online grocery store BigBasket’s HR head Hari TN thinks recreation rooms, gyms, libraries, quiet corners and rooms with bean bags are better options for destressing than breaking things. But he adds: “I guess some people find that (breaking things) a destressing activity.”According to the millennial Sharma, needing a “frustration zone” means there’s a serious problem with the company. “Why are employees so frustrated that they need to break things?” Psychologist Hingorrany says she rarely sees young people happy any more, and blames odd working hours, lack of social support and a culture of instant gratification for it. Ikya’s Bhatia too, says that facilities and timings have improved for the worker, but, because of technology, “You always carry the office in your pocket.”Suman Gopalan, HR head at cloud-based software startup Freshworks, says her overwhelmingly millennial workforce don’t separate work and life. “They don’t have a 9-to-5 concept of work … For them, life is work and work is life.” For GoWork's Singh, the zone is a hit among his members. He wants to bring in a car or two into it next, and “Maybe even a sledgehammer.”","Jan 02, 2019, 01:44 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/taking-a-break-a-co-working-space-has-introduced-a-frustration-zone/articleshow/67331938.cms

Japan stocks can be haven in a bleak world,,"By Ronald W ChanGlobal equity investors have reason to be concerned: The economic outlook is worsening, interest rates are rising and tensions in the U.S.-China relationship could further harm growth. But all is not bleak. Japan provides a measure of certainty and promise, with a stable government, expanding economy, improving return on equity and booming tourism.Japanese stocks aren’t reflecting these positive factors. The Topix entered a bear market in 2018, dropping more than 22 per cent from its January peak to a two-year low. The index closed out its worst December performance in 59 years on Friday. 1 Year to date, international investors have sold more than $48 billion of shares.Yet the country remains on track to record the longest period of economic growth, at 74 consecutive months, in the post-war era, according to a report in the Nikkei that cited the government’s monthly economic report.Granted, risks to the outlook are increasing. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has noted, in particular, dim prospects for overseas economic development and diminishing demand for Japanese exports. Meanwhile, an increase in the sales tax to 10 per cent from 8 per cent scheduled to take effect in October 2019 will weigh on domestic consumption. Still, Kuroda has promised to keep close watch and respond if needed by cutting interest rates, boosting asset buying and accelerating the pace of money printing.The political environment is supportive. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won the ruling party leadership election in September, empowering him to implement pro-growth structural reforms with little opposition. The so-called “Third Arrow” of his Abenomics program is designed to promote expansion of Japan’s economic output by improving workforce diversity, adjusting corporate taxation, and reforming heavily protected industries such as agriculture and healthcare.Many Japanese companies have reported record profits in recent quarters. Return on equity for the MSCI Japan Index has doubled to 9.8 per cent from 4.4 per cent in 2012, according to a report by Morgan Stanley. Improvements came from better operating margins and a reduction in taxes, interest, and non-operating expenses. ROE could reach 12 per cent by 2025, the New York-based investment bank predicts.Though Japan’s long-term prospects seem relatively clear-cut, declining fertility rates remain problematic. The current population of more than 127 million is expected to shrink by a third in less than 50 years. This doesn’t deter Jesper Koll, chief executive officer of fund manager WisdomTree Japan Inc., who told me recently: “Look on the bright side. The older generation will pass its wealth to the next, and along with it, substantial newfound purchasing power.”Notwithstanding declining fertility, other areas of Japan’s economy continue to show improvement, such as tourism. Fifteen years ago, the total number of foreign visitors to Japan was roughly 5 million. This year, the country welcomed 30 million tourists, and with an anticipated 40 million planning to visit in 2020 ahead of the Olympics, the government is upgrading the country’s infrastructure to help businesses deliver products and services.Those who choose to invest in Japan in the New Year should focus on companies exposed to domestic consumption such as Matsumotokiyoshi Holdings Co., one of the country’s largest drugstore chains, and Bic Camera Inc., a one-stop shop for all things electronic. Local companies with international appeal may also be worthwhile investments, such as athletic shoemaker Asics Corp. and confectionery producer Morinaga & Co. Those averse to individual stock-picking can consider acquiring broad exposure to the Topix. The forward price-earnings ratio for the index is at 11.8 times, its lowest level in the past five years. In fact, fewer than 60 days in the past decade saw the Topix trading lower than the current multiple.

New Year special: Best mutual funds for new investors in 2019,Many individuals firm up their plans to invest in mutual funds in the New Year. And 2019 is not different.,"Many individuals firm up their plans to invest in mutual funds in the New Year. And 2019 is not different. Etmutualfunds.com has already started receiving many messages from new investors on our official Facebook page: most of them want to know which is the best mutual fund scheme for a new investor.Well, many mutual fund advisors believe investors should choose a scheme (or schemes) based on their investment goals, horizon, and risk profile. For example, if they are investing for a short-term goal, they should opt for a debt mutual fund schemes that match their horizon and risk profile. Similarly, if they are investing for a long-term goal, they can invest in an equity scheme based on their horizon and risk profile.To explain, a conservative investor looking to park money for a few weeks can settle for an ultra short term scheme. If the person wants to invest in a year or two, she can opt for a short-term debt scheme with a low risk profile. Similarly, the person can invest in a largecap scheme if she is investing to achieve a long-term goal.Now, is there a special scheme that is ideal for first-time investors? Well, many advisors believe that tax-saving mutual fund schemes or ELSS funds could be an ideal way for a first-time investor to step into the world of equity mutual fund schemes.These help investors to save taxes of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. They come with a mandatory lock-in period of three years which many advisors say would help investors to get used to the volatility typically associated with equity mutual fund schemes. Advisors point out that many ELSS investors have graduated to other equity mutual fund schemes over the years.Some mutual fund advisors believe that new investors should start with aggressive hybrid schemes. These schemes invest in a mix of equity (at least 65 per cent) and debt. Because of the mixed portfolio they are relatively less volatile during a bad phase in the market. The debt part of the portfolio cushions impact of volatility in the portfolio.Some mutual fund advisors are of the view that investors should opt for largecap schemes as they are the least volatile among equity schemes. They reason that since these schemes invest 80 per cent of the corpus in top 100 stocks by market capitalisation, they would help investors to grow their investment without too much volatility.After the recategorization exercise by Sebi, a small group of advisors are of the view that multicap schemes are ideal for new investors to get into the market. As per the new norms, the fund manager of multicap schemes have the freedom to choose his investments based on his view of the market. This would help these schemes to shift between marektcaps and sectors easily. Other equity schemes would find it very difficult to do this as they are mandated to invest in a certain fashion after the recategorization of schemes.Finally, what should new investors do? Well, we believe that once they have made up their mind to achieve their long-term financial goals by investing in equity mutual fund schemes, investors should ideally choose a scheme based on their risk profile. Also, they should invest with a relatively longer horizon (seven to 10 years) in mind, review the performance of the scheme at least once a year and take appropriate actions.

Etmutualfunds.com has already started receiving many messages from new investors on our official Facebook page: most of them want to know which is the best mutual fund scheme for a new investor.Well, many mutual fund advisors believe investors should choose a scheme (or schemes) based on their investment goals, horizon, and risk profile. For example, if they are investing for a short-term goal, they should opt for a debt mutual fund schemes that match their horizon and risk profile. Similarly, if they are investing for a long-term goal, they can invest in an equity scheme based on their horizon and risk profile.To explain, a conservative investor looking to park money for a few weeks can settle for an ultra short term scheme. If the person wants to invest in a year or two, she can opt for a short-term debt scheme with a low risk profile. Similarly, the person can invest in a largecap scheme if she is investing to achieve a long-term goal.Now, is there a special scheme that is ideal for first-time investors? Well, many advisors believe that tax-saving mutual fund schemes or ELSS funds could be an ideal way for a first-time investor to step into the world of equity mutual fund schemes.These help investors to save taxes of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. They come with a mandatory lock-in period of three years which many advisors say would help investors to get used to the volatility typically associated with equity mutual fund schemes. Advisors point out that many ELSS investors have graduated to other equity mutual fund schemes over the years.Some mutual fund advisors believe that new investors should start with aggressive hybrid schemes. These schemes invest in a mix of equity (at least 65 per cent) and debt. Because of the mixed portfolio they are relatively less volatile during a bad phase in the market. The debt part of the portfolio cushions impact of volatility in the portfolio.Some mutual fund advisors are of the view that investors should opt for largecap schemes as they are the least volatile among equity schemes. They reason that since these schemes invest 80 per cent of the corpus in top 100 stocks by market capitalisation, they would help investors to grow their investment without too much volatility.After the recategorization exercise by Sebi, a small group of advisors are of the view that multicap schemes are ideal for new investors to get into the market. As per the new norms, the fund manager of multicap schemes have the freedom to choose his investments based on his view of the market. This would help these schemes to shift between marektcaps and sectors easily. Other equity schemes would find it very difficult to do this as they are mandated to invest in a certain fashion after the recategorization of schemes.Finally, what should new investors do? Well, we believe that once they have made up their mind to achieve their long-term financial goals by investing in equity mutual fund schemes, investors should ideally choose a scheme based on their risk profile. Also, they should invest with a relatively longer horizon (seven to 10 years) in mind, review the performance of the scheme at least once a year and take appropriate actions.

5 ways to work with a difficult boss, Figuring out different communication styles can help you understand where the gap is and how it can be addressed in the most effective way. ,"Is your performance at work suffering because your boss is a poor communicator? Sreeradha D Basu gets you tips from experts on how to deal with such bosses who are difficult to work with and who fail to motivate team members simply because they refuse to communicate effectively.Schedule a meetingEmployees should not get into a confrontation with a boss who is not willing to communicate. “Rather, such employees should fix up a meeting with the manager to discuss their role and deliverables. This will help break the ice,” says Satish Singh, national head-human resources at PNB Housing Finance. Chiranjiv Patel, managing director at construction and engineering group PC Snehal Group concurred, saying, “Weekly meetings with the boss help both to be on the same page. Expression of thoughts can build a valuable trust between the team and the boss.”Communication styleObserving your boss’ interactions with others can work in your favour. Figuring out different communication styles can help you understand where the gap is and how it can be addressed in the most effective way. “Try to discover the approach of your boss’ communication and follow it. Sometimes it is important to communicate with others in their style to be understood,” says Patel.Gentle reminders workReminding and re-reminding your boss about relevant issues in a gentle and polite manner makes your presence felt. This will ease the way to respond back, says Patel.Gain the boss’ confidenceEmployees should try to earn the confidence of their manager so that the latter feels that the employees can be relied upon for any assignment. “The employee should take the lead to showcase his interest in knowing what needs to be done for better performance. S/he should have a proactive approach towards any task and should suggest new ideas rather than asking the manager the way forward,” says PNB Housing Finance’s Singh.Gather info from othersIf other efforts come to naught, try to find other colleagues or seniors who can guide you. Gathering information from various people within the organisation can provide some clarity as well as some tips from others who may have figured out the trick to communicate effectively with your boss.","Jan 01, 2019, 01:01 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/5-ways-to-work-with-a-difficult-boss/articleshow/67332019.cms

Joint Parliamentary Committee nod to Citizenship Act changes,"The BJP-dominated JPC headed by Rajendra Agarwal cleared the Bill after most opposition amendments were rejected by 6-13 votes, it is learnt. ","A Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on Monday cleared the Bill to amend the Citizenship Act 1955. The Bill seeks to grant citizenship to people from minority communities — Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians - from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan after six years of residence in India instead of 12 even if they don’t possess any proper document. Muslims are a notable omission from the list on the ground that they constitute the majority communities in the three neighbouring nations. The BJP-dominated JPC headed by Rajendra Agarwal cleared the Bill after most opposition amendments were rejected by 6-13 votes, it is learnt. With this the stage is set for the government to bring the Bill in the ongoing session of Parliament with the intention of pushing for its passage before the session ends. The JPC pushing the Bill through and the government readying to give it legislatitve framework also meant the BJP is resolved to face ally AGP’s threat of walking out of the NDA if the Bill is passed. The legislation is expected to have political implications in many North East states, especially Assam, and also in West Bengal, something on which the BJP seems to be betting on before the elections. Many Opposition parties including the Congress, TMC, BJD and Left had expressed their resevatons about many provisions in the proposed amendments to the Bill. With less than a week left for the adjournment of the winter session, it remains to be seen whether the government will be able to glide through the Bill in both the Houses or whether it will face political deadlock.","Jan 01, 2019, 09:04 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/joint-parliamentary-committee-nod-to-citizenship-act-changes/articleshow/67332044.cms
Here's why the cash-out mentality is becoming popular with startup founders,"The Bansals, Bose, Shah and Kashyap represent a new face of founders who don’t see themselves spending a lifetime at their startups. ","Early in the New Year, Abhijit Bose — or Bobby, as he’s known among friends — will join WhatsApp as its first India head, an unexpected reversal from an entrepreneur to a professional. This graduate of Harvard Business School and Cornell University, had cofounded Ezetap, a payments solutions firm.And later in January, Ashish Kashyap will start his next venture, INDWealth, a fintech venture that has already raised $30 million from Steadview Capital. Kashyap had sold travel booking firm Ibibo Group to MakeMyTrip (MMT) in 2017.  Flipkart’s Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal also exited — albeit for different reasons — after Walmart acquired Flipkart. And three years after exiting from FreeCharge, Kunal Shah is back in the startup arena with financial service giver Cred, launched in November 2018, targeting consumers with high credit worthiness. Shah raised $25 million, led by Sequoia and Ribbit Capital.The Bansals, Bose, Shah and Kashyap represent a new face of founders who don’t see themselves spending a lifetime at their startups. They’ll be happy to helm a messaging app, start another venture, mentor or angel fund. “I exited Ibibo post its 100% acquisition,” says Kashyap. “Founders like me like to drive and control what we build. Post acquisition, one has knowingly given the asset in someone else’s hands. Therefore, it’s best to exit at your highest point and build something new.”Kashyap founded Ibibo in 2007 and exited 10 years later. His next venture is a full stack wealth management platform that brings together assets, liabilities and taxation on a single app —using machine learning and artificial intelligence. Kashyap believes, “One should create exits for shareholders, either via initial public offer (IPO) or acquisition within 10 years.”Clearly, entrepreneurs today think differently from the likes of NR Narayana Murthy and cofounders, who built Infosys into a multi-billion dollar global company, even taking turns to run it.“Exit was not in the DNA of that era,” points out Ankur Pahwa, national leader, ecommerce and consumer internet, EY India. Going public was seen as the best option to unlock value, unlike today’s startup scene — driven by venture (VC) and private equity (PE) investments — that ensures cash counters keep ringing.Also, in the previous era, founders like Murthy looked at creating profitable businesses, while disruptive startups today burn considerable cash ostensibly to change consumer habits, such as new ways of shopping or transacting on digital platforms. In today’s model, markets, particularly in India, will be less inclined to back cash burn strategies, cutting out IPOs and encouraging PE/VC fund generation.Besides, says Pahwa, “selling a business is much more acceptable now, even as failure is not frowned upon. The ecosystem has evolved. Value creation happens lot faster.”  THINKING BIG AND EXITING SMALL“No one thinks of exiting at start,” says Vidhyashankar, executive director, Grant Thornton.The stats are loaded against a startup getting anywhere — 80% of them fail. Often the founder’s aim is simple — get the idea off the ground, acquire users and customers, show it works, scale the business and get someone to back it. And if, a big if, everything goes right, build Google, Facebook or Amazon size ventures. While these three still have founders directly or indirectly running the show, with founders stepping back to bring in professionals, most local startup founders exit much before they get anywhere near that size.Sampad Swain, cofounder, Instamojo, says, “Trying to build a business out of a product and a product out of an idea is an exhausting exercise. Some give up once they feel they have made their money.” Instamojo is the 36-year-old’s third cofounded startup; he sold the first and shut down the second.A venture investor who did not want to be identified points out that most startups are founded by IIT-IIM graduates from middleclass families who have never seen wealth. “Even getting $10 million is big money. They won’t mind exiting and parking that money to ensure financial safety for themselves and their family,” he says. They may hang around for longer in progressive ventures. Swain’s third startup, for instance, taps a much larger market as it has grown from a payment gateway in 2012 to offering a range of services for micro, medium and small enterprises. “Financial services is a multi-billion-dollar opportunity and we are here for the long haul,” he says. Instamojo been funded by the likes of Kalaari Capital, 500StartUps and Blume Ventures.On the other hand, Kashyap assumed the role of president and cofounder at Ibibo post MakeMyTrip acquiring it. Kashyap was one of the main architects, along with MMT chief executive Deep Kalra, of the $1.8-billion deal, the largest in the Indian internet space till Walmart’s $16-billion buyout of Flipkart in May 2018.At the time of quitting MakeMyTrip, Kashyap had told ET, “It’s been a decade-long journey. Post merger, the next step was to build something new and integrate the brand. That has been done. The structure is set and the business is at a high point. Therefore, the timing is just perfect.”A DILEMMA FOR FOUNDERSAs the startup scales, it attracts more money, which helps the founder expand. At the same time, the founder’s stake reduces. A typical startup goes via five rounds of funding. By the time it reaches Series D funding, the founder’s stake could be less than 20%. The employee option pool is 15-20% and the rest is taken up by investors.Murali Talasila, leader, startups, PwC India, says, “Net value goes up and money-wise, there’s an increase in value of stock. If a startup reaches $500 million valuation, a founder may start evaluating his or her options.” This is also generally when the ‘passion to start something’ has cooled and the founder is confronted with some harsh realities.“The founder’s stake reduces considerably over time,” says Swain. “And unlike in the more mature Silicon Valley, in India, if I own 5% of the company, my decision making will also be 5%! Investors here look at things differently.” He explains the need to pocket money and exit as, “A lot of entrepreneurs face a dilemma, ‘I don’t have a controlling stake, what am I doing here?’ And this gets reinforced as their decisions start getting questioned.”A Bengaluru-based serial entrepreneur, on condition of anonymity, says, “The only impediment to building scale is access to capital. As a result, founders lose control over time and tend to accept it. When you raise money, it’s a trade-off between control and faster growth. Investors are acting in their own interest, which is to maximise returns.”So each of them – founder and investorlooks after his or her own interest, a path that frequently leads to the founder’s exit.Perhaps to this end, cab-hailing firm Ola made sweeping changes to its shareholder terms in May 2017 — strengthening founders’ rights and restricting those of SoftBank and other investors. Any transfer of equity shares by Ola investors, representing 10% or more of the company’s capital, will need to be approved by Bhavish Aggarwal and cofounder Ankit Bhati.Early that year, Tiger Global Management (also an investor in Ola) had appointed its seniormost India employee, Kalyan Krishnamurthy, the chief executive of Flipkart, replacing cofounder Binny Bansal.A Mumbai-based person closely associated with India’s startup scene says, “That founders will push for greater autonomy and control is not new. They’ll try and do what Aggarwal of Ola is trying to do. They will restrict voting rights. I think ringfencing is likely to increase. Bottomline is that founders want control, irrespective of whether they exit or not.”  HAVE I GOT ENOUGH GOLD?Niren Shah, managing director, Norwest Venture Partners, says, “People do take out their first $1 million. Once they strike gold, they stick around in the hope of finding more, though the more they get, the more stake they will dilute – they’ll own less of that gold mine.”The economics of VC/PE funds may require multi-billion-dollar exits. The economics of founders’ lives does not. And if they see it from the investors’ viewpoint, it could lead to irrational fund-raising — perhaps a fire sale like TaxiForSure (bought by rival Ola) if funds run out or seeing the dream startup drop off the leader board, like Snapdeal.Jitendra Gupta, cofounder, CitrusPay, and managing director, PayU, believes timing the exit is a very individual decision. “Selling a fraction of stake is okay as the founder needs to get some comfort for his family. However, a large stake sale can distract her/him from managing his/her money and other investments, which are suboptimal,” he says. This decides what path the founder will take — exit, start again or mentor.EY’s Pahwa says, “Today’s founders are not thinking of building for life, but to create wealth and monetise. They are thinking of transaction a lot faster. Building and exiting a successful company, in their view, is a 10-year goal. This way, they see three things — build value, create impact and create a larger impact.”Exit, restart, mentor or fund — this mental throw of the dice may lead India’s budding entrepreneurs any way in 2019 too. After all, there’s ample room in startup ecosystem to accommodate all three.","Jan 01, 2019, 12:46 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/features/heres-why-the-cash-out-mentality-is-becoming-popular-with-startup-founders/articleshow/67331976.cms

France's Emmanuel Macron pledges more reform medicine in 'decisive' 2019,"Promised overhauls of France's unemployment benefits, civil service and public pensions will be undertaken in the coming year, Macron said in his televised New Year message.","PARIS - France's embattled president, Emmanuel Macron, vowed on Monday to press on with his reform agenda in 2019 despite a spate of ""yellow vest"" protests that have challenged his government and extended a plunge in his approval ratings. Promised overhauls of France's unemployment benefits, civil service and public pensions will be undertaken in the coming year, Macron said in his televised New Year message. Confounding some expectations of a more contrite message, Macron struck an unapologetic note as he urged voters to face up to economic realities underpinning recently enacted reforms of French labour rules, and others yet to come. ""In recent years, we've engaged in a blatant denial of reality,"" Macron said in the address, delivered - unusually - from a standing position in his Elysee Palace office. ""We can't work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending."" In a veiled attack on the far-left and hard-right groupings active on the fringes of the often violent protests, Macron also decried self-appointed ""spokespeople for a hateful mob"" who he said had targeted foreigners, Jews, gays and the press. Almost 20 months after he became France's youngest president, Macron's popularity is at the lowest level recorded in modern French history. It stood at just 24 percent in late December compared to 47 percent a year earlier, according to a Journal du Dimanche aggregate of polls, as he struggled to draw a line under numerous setbacks. The current wave of demonstrations, which have brought disruption and destruction to Paris and other major cities, has yet to abate despite fiscal giveaways and a increase in the wage for the poorest workers. Protesters were expected to join the New Year crowds thronging Paris's Champs-Elysees Avenue overnight, amid a heavy police presence. A scandal over Macron's former bodyguard Alexandre Benalla, who was eventually fired after video emerged of him beating protestors, has resurfaced with the revelation that he continued to travel on diplomatic passports and exchange messages with Macron long after his dismissal. Macron said efforts to bolster international controls on immigration and tax evasion would be at the heart of European Union proposals he plans to announce in ""coming weeks"" - to be pursued in parallel with a domestic agenda reconciling ambitious reform with France's commitment to social solidarity. ""This is the line I have followed since the first day of my mandate, and which I plan to keep following,"" he said. ""This coming year, 2019, is in my view a decisive one.""","Jan 01, 2019, 09:28 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/frances-emmanuel-macron-pledges-more-reform-medicine-in-decisive-2019/articleshow/67332257.cms

"With 1 million homes still in the dark, Modi government misses power goal",This will delay the success of a marquee $2.3-billion goal that Modi was planning to showcase before polls.,"by Rajesh Kumar Singh and Anindya UpadhyayPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s government missed a self-imposed target to electrify every home, delaying the success of a marquee $2.3 billion development goal that his party plans to showcase before national elections early this year.After bringing electricity connections to 23.9 million households across 25 states, about 1.05 million homes in four states still lack power, the government’s Press Information Bureau said in a statement Monday, the year-end deadline.Power Minister R.K. Singh reaffirmed as recently as late November that the government would meet its Dec. 31 target, which had earlier been moved up by three months.Achieving full energy access has been one of Modi’s key reforms amid his outreach to rural communities, where his Bharatiya Janata Party has been challenged by dissatisfaction and joblessness. Electrification success would be a political boon for Modi and the BJP as they face national elections in the coming months.The central government has set several milestones for its rural electrification plan since Modi came to power in 2014 -- bringing connections to all villages by May 1, then to all homes by the end 2018. After full electrification is achieved, the next goal will be to ensure reliable uninterrupted supplies by March 31.Modi’s government in September 2017 set out to electrify nearly 40 million homes, a target that has been shrinking and shifting along the way.As of Monday, the total number of homes targeted for electrification stood at about 25 million, more than one-third fewer than the original plan. The target was revised downward to account for families that migrated to cities and households living under one roof that were grouped together for a common power connection, P.V. Ramesh, chairman of REC Ltd., which is executing the rural electrification work, said in early December.The deadline was also brought forward from its original March 31. The government’s statement Monday, which said the states of Assam, Rajasthan, Meghalaya and Chhattisgarh are still to be electrified, made no mention of the Dec. 31 target. It also mentioned that the state of Uttar Pradesh started a campaign to identify any “left out” households and provide electricity connections.“Completing this program in a time-bound manner is a big achievement, but it will have to be complemented with more reforms at the state utility level,” Kameswara Rao, who leads power and mining practices at PwC India, said before the announcement.","Jan 01, 2019, 09:33 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/with-1-million-homes-still-in-the-dark-modi-government-misses-power-goal/articleshow/67332253.cms
‘India is becoming an entrepreneurship model for the world’: John Chambers,"John Chambers feels India’s startup ecosystem is on the right track, with positive government initiatives and incentives. The cashing-out mentality is simply because it’s early days yet.","Technology czar John Chambers, founder and chief executive of JC2 Ventures, which has invested in 16 startups around the world, says it’s important to remember that cashing out early is not an ‘Indian trend.’ His former company, Cisco Systems, had acquired 180 companies while Chambers was at its helm. In an email interview with Shelley Singh, Chambers takes a close look at startups , in India and abroad, and the issues founders face. Edited excerpts.  ALL ABOUT THE EXITSixty to 70% of all startups, whether in the US, Europe, India or another part of the world, have an exit strategy of being acquired by another company (that is, cashing out early), or by a private equity firm that takes the company to a different level.That said, what is currently missing in India are the ‘acquirers,’ if you will, which are often large technology giants or big enterprise companies. As the startup market in India becomes more robust and the business-to-business market continues to develop, I think you will see this change.To build on that, a big driver of this ‘cash out exit strategy’ is likely founders feeling that going public is not achievable. They are struggling to scale, cannot get access to capital they need, do not have candidates coming in with the right skills because technology is changing so quickly –the list goes on.Yet, I truly believe startups and micromultinationals will be the drivers of growth and innovation in the digital age — using technology to challenge traditional business models — rather than the large Fortune 500 companies that exist today. In fact, I predict that 40% of those big players won’t even exist 10 years from now.GOING AWAY FROM GOING PUBLICIndia’s startup scene is still relatively new. The country only recently started ramping up its focus on startups and changes the government has implemented in terms of regulations, tax policies, et al, have been very positive. But these things simply take time. Consider, a single startup usually takes seven to 10 years before it is really positioned to grow headcount or even think about going for an initial public offering (IPO).In general, the biggest challenge for startups — and not exclusive to India — is scaling. If you look at the US, far fewer startups are going public than even five years ago. And in France, there are only a handful of unicorns, even with its laser-focused efforts to foster and encourage entrepreneurship. We need to grow this (entrepreneurship) exponentially in countries because startups will drive job creation and economic growth in the future.I’m doing this at JC2 Ventures, helping startups grow and scale – and I strongly believe India is becoming a model for the rest of the world. The government has focused on fostering startups and entrepreneurship. It has made policy changes easing scaling up for startups and put a renewed focus on helping citizens become fluent in the language of technology.Easy venture capital money actually delays the startup on its growth journey. It’s a lot easier to scale without an IPO and worrying about all the regulations that come with going public too early. Growth and change of any kind take time and startups are no different from a large multinational, or even an entire country, going through change.A TREND NOT UNIQUE TO INDIAFrom the time a company is founded, it typically takes about 10 years to even be able to consider an IPO. Exit strategies along the way are often focused on acquisitions or taking the company private with a private equity firm. The thing to keep in mind is that this is not unique to India.Even in the US, home to the famed Silicon Valley, there is no entitlement. Startups take time to grow and scale (such as Uber, which was founded in 2009 and has only started plans to pursue an IPO in 2019).In terms of the US economy, I’m extremely focused on the low number of IPOs and the huge implications that has for us. Only 182 companies went public in 2017, down from 706 in 1996. This year’s forecast is around 230 companies would go public, which is better than last year but not nearly high enough.In reality, we need this to increase 3-4x in order to create the number of jobs we need in future. We need to put renewed focus on innovation and startups in the US, otherwise others will surpass us as the ‘startup nations.’FOUNDER’S OUT, INVESTORS IN?The simple answer is, no. It is the startup founders who provide creativity, ideas and take risks at every stage of a startup. All those things are fundamental to growth of a company and the larger startup ecosystem. PE/VCs are simply enablers of this growth, providing funding and management expertise as appropriate.As a VC myself, I enjoy working with young chief executives and mentoring them. I believe startups will not only drive jobs in the future, but that they are also the key to economic growth and innovation in the digital age. After decades of leading a global giant in the tech industry, I like being able to pick and choose what I do now and where I focus my time, energy and, frankly, money. Startups are like grandchildren – they soak up ideas like sponges and I like being able to help them think out the strategy of a new idea and getting them excited about it before they implement and execute.","Jan 01, 2019, 01:06 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/india-is-becoming-an-entrepreneurship-model-for-the-world-john-chambers/articleshow/67332196.cms

"As action moves to cloud, server sales take a hit",IDC says absence of big-dollar deals from IT and ITeS service providers the main cause,"BENGALURU: Server sales in India declined for the first time due to weak demand from IT services firms, whose clients are increasingly renting space on the cloud to host applications instead of setting up their infrastructure.The overall server market in India shrank 8.1% to $276.6 million (Rs 1,925 crore) in the quarter through September over the previous year, technology researcher IDC said last week. The x86 server market, which is used by IT services firms to host applications on their campuses, has contracted, it said.  The decline is due to the absence of multi-million-dollar deals from IT and ITeS service providers and spill over of telecom deals into the subsequent quarters, IDC said. Professional services accounted for 57.5% of the x86 server market revenue in the quarter, followed by telecom with 10.4%. Manufacturing and banking were slow during the period due to limited new deals and small upgrades.Traditionally, IT firms have been the main buyers of servers in the country, to be used for hosting applications they build and test for global clients. Many of them also maintain these applications for their clients. However, a shift towards renting software on the cloud by clients has led these firms to reduce investment in servers.Analysts said there were examples of organisations not renewing server deals since they had adequate empty storage space with movement of applications to the cloud. “There is still a large market, but it is seeing slow growth,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of Greyhound Research. “A lot of these hardware setups were installed five years ago or so, but as more deals are coming up for renewal, they are not renewing those contracts since a large portion of applications moved to cloud”.As more businesses see “adequate” empty server infrastructure after migration to the cloud, they have enough existing facility to accommodate new operations. This is reducing the number of renewals for server solution providers, he said.Hardware firms that make and sell servers, however, said the slowdown in demand from IT services firms in the third quarter of 2018 was a one-off phenomenon and that the overall market was witnessing an upward swing.“We believe that the Q3 market decline is not indicative of the larger trend which has demonstrated increased spending on server infrastructure through the last few quarters,” said Manish Gupta, general manager of Infrastructure Solutions Group at Dell EMC, India.","Jan 01, 2019, 09:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/as-action-moves-to-cloud-server-sales-take-a-hit/articleshow/67332358.cms
Trump signs legislation enhancing US leadership in Indo-Pacific region into law,"Describing India as a major defence partner, the Act says this designation institutionalises the progress made to facilitate defence trade and technology sharing between the two countries","US President Donald Trump signed into law a legislation on Monday aimed at enhancing America's leadership in the Indo-Pacific region, strengthening multifaced ties with India and calling out Chinese actions that ""undermine"" the rules-based international system.Recognising the vital role of the strategic partnership between the United States and India in promoting peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region, Section 204 of the Act calls for strengthening and broadening of diplomatic, economic, and security ties between the two countries.The Indo-Pacific is a bio-geographic region, comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea.In a statement, Trump shared the objective of the Congress with respect to maintaining the strength and security of the United States, but did not guarantee to abide by the effort of the Congress to dictate the policy of the US in external, military, and foreign affairs, or to require the executive branch to undertake certain diplomatic initiatives with international partners.The Act reaffirms its commitment to the New Framework for the 2005 US-India Defence Relationship, Defence Technology and Trade Initiative launched in 2012; the 2015 Joint Strategic Vision for the Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region, and 2017 Joint Statement on Prosperity Through Partnership.Describing India as a major defence partner, the Act says this designation institutionalises the progress made to facilitate defence trade and technology sharing between the two countries, elevates defence trade and technology cooperation to a level commensurate with the closest allies and partners of the US.It also facilitates technology sharing including license-free access to a wide range of dual-use technologies, after taking into account national security concerns; and joint exercises, coordination on defence strategy and policy, military exchanges, and port calls in support of defence cooperation between the two countries, the Act says.The Act, which was introduced in April by Senators Cory Gardner and Ed Markey, who are chairman and member of Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, along with Senators Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin, endorses quadrilateral dialogue between the United States, Australia, India and Japan.Such a quadrilateral dialogue, it said, is vital to addressing pressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region in order to promote a rules-based order; respect for international law; and a free and open Indo-Pacific, the Act says.According to the Act, it is the policy of the US to develop and commit to a long-term strategic vision and a comprehensive, multifaceted, and principled United States policy for the Indo-Pacific region that secures its vital national security interests and its allies and partners; and promotes American prosperity and economic interests by advancing economic growth and development of a rules-based Indo-Pacific economic community.""The core tenets of the US-backed international system are being challenged, including by China's illegal construction and militarization of artificial features in the South China Sea and coercive economic practices; North Korea's acceleration of its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities; and the increased presence throughout Southeast Asia of the Islamic State and other international terrorist organisations that threaten the United States,"" it says.","Jan 01, 2019, 09:49 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/trump-signs-legislation-enhancing-us-leadership-in-indo-pacific-region-into-law/articleshow/67332392.cms

Smart lighting is Wipro’s bright idea for the future,"The market size of commercial indoor and outdoor lighting is pegged at between Rs 7,000-8,000 crore, which is what the company is focusing on.","Wipro Lighting is betting big on the connected lighting space to grow its commercial lighting business over the next few years It has tied up with Cisco for Power over Ethernet (PoE) and pure-LiFi for Internet of Lighting solutions, areas it believes that commercial lighting is moving to. The lighting business contributes 26% of revenue to the $1-billion Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting business. Anuj Dhir, business head, Commercial Lighting Business, Wipro said that it was seeing a lot of interest in smart lighting solutions for both offices, as well as Smart City projects. It has created a portfolio of products specifically for these, which include sensor and IoT-based solutions. The market size of commercial indoor and outdoor lighting is pegged at between Rs 7,000-8,000 crore, which is what the company is focusing on.Wipro recently announced a partnership with Schreder for IoT-based solutions for Smart Cities and smart campuses like a ‘shuffle smart pole’ which could be used as a hub to collect and transport data for multiple services through the city. “Power over Ethernet (PoE) solutions are gaining traction in Europe and the US. We’ve done a few pilots in India and are seeing an increase in interest,” said Dhir. The company is collaborating with Cisco on this and betting big on this trend as it is a safer and more secure way of connecting lights, and also makes it possible to introduce sensor-based solutions. This then allows the facilities manager to remotely manage the lights and temperature in the room depending on occupancy levels.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories","Jan 01, 2019, 09:58 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/smart-lighting-is-wipros-bright-idea-for-the-future/articleshow/67332439.cms
IIFL’s Abhimanyu Sofat’s 2 largecap bets for 2019,"
It is very difficult to get into sectoral themes in 2019, says the IIFL VP-research. ","Continue to be bullish on Axis Bank and L&T this year, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-research, IIFL, tells ET Now.        Edited excerpts:  Would the upcoming elections in 2019 have a big bearing on the markets? Obviously! Whenever an election result comes in, there is an increased volatility. Structurally, right from 1990, we had various governments coming in -- be it the Narasimha Rao government or before that VP Singh, Chandra Shekhar and later, the Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh governments.  Structurally, if you have a long-term view in India, then who comes to power does not matter. There may be 5% here and there movement in the index because of the elections. But earnings growth is the key factor which will determine where the market would be two years from now. What we are clearly seeing is that things are improving at least on the sales side. Like for example, in the last quarter, top line growth for corporate India was close to around 28%.  On the bottom line, there was pressure because of crude price but now with the crude price coming down by close to around 26% in last two months, we are seeing the margin pressure easing and for this reason, 2019 is significantly better compared to 2018 from a risk-reward perspective.  We would be bullish on a stock-specific basis across sectors where the earning traction of companies is relatively better compared to competition. That is the thought for 2019 as of now. It is very difficult to get into sectoral themes in 2019 because based on how the companies are positioning, we are likely to see a very robust kind of growth all across. It has to be always a dispersion in terms of earning growth as well as return for investors in 2019.What would you advocate as top buys this year? From a largecap perspective, Axis Bank looks quite decent at two time price to book earning growth of around 17% and with the RBI report also indicating that going forward NPAs stress may be reducing. In wholesale banks, private banks should be looked at rather than bottom fishing on the PSU side, because we still do not know what will happen there.  On the PSU side, we have seen that loans to SMEs have increased dramatically over last one, one and a half years. So what happens on the asset quality there is something which one does not know of. From a safety perspective, Axis Bank with a new CEO joining in and changes happening at top level, looks to be quite good to us.  Also, Larsen & Toubro is another stock which looks quite good to us as we head into recovery on the capex cycle. So these are the two largecap stocks that we currently are quite positive on. All brokerages are bullish on EPC companies whether it is Ashok Buildcon or Dilip Buildcon or NCC or L&T. I have always seen that too much of consensus is dangerous. One reason could be that the earnings downgrade for some of the companies may not happen because of the kind of fall that we have seen in some of these names would have led to analysts cutting down their estimates. I am sure after this particular quarter’s results, you will see a pruning of target prices by most of the analysts for some of these companies.  Look at EPC companies from two perspectives. One is that clearly there is a mindset that there will be improvement in the capex cycle. Interest rates are not going to go up going forward and because of that there will be some improvement in earnings.  Power sector is one sector where still we have not seen a traction in terms of growth going forward except for if you look at order book of companies like KEC which are doing pretty well. So from EPC company perspective, we need to be quite stock specific of which particular company we like, like for example in case of power we like something like KEC where growth is expected to be pretty good. Overall I would say that one needs to look at each one separately. In case of Dilip Buildcon there were some other concerns also which led to the fall in the price. So one has to evaluate everything separately in debt and equities and the thing which lot of these companies are grappling with. I would advise a caution on some of these names by investors and not expect 70-80% kind of upside in these stocks over next one year.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:06 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/iifls-abhimanyu-sofats-2-largecap-bets-for-2019/articleshow/67332456.cms

Red tape grounds P2P startups as investors stay clear of space,"While multiple P2P lending startups which have recently got licensed by the central bank have shown promising growth, industry insiders say that they are not being able to expand business quickly because of capital constraints.","BENGALURU: The latest entrants into the digital lending sector, peer-to-peer lending platforms, are facing an uphill task attracting investors with regulatory restrictions limiting their growth potential.While multiple P2P lending startups which have recently got licensed by the central bank have shown promising growth, industry insiders say that they are not being able to expand business quickly because of capital constraints.“Venture capital (VC) interest in this sector has been somewhat subdued as potential investors are waiting for the lending limits to be removed,” said Surendra Jalan, chief executive officer, OMLP2P. “Without investor support growth will be a bit slow for the overall sector, though demand is very high.”  OMLP2P is a Mumbai-based lending platform and disburses around Rs 20 lakh per month. Another Mumbai-based P2P lending startup Paisadukaan’s founder Rajiv Ranjan also said that VCs have been shying away from this sector because of the limitation imposed by the RBI.“Unavailability of VC funds tied up with huge operational costs, continuous maintenance of Rs 2 crore net-owned fund have started affecting the growth in terms of the volume that the industry had promised,” he said.The overall P2P industry is still at its nascent stage with industry insiders projecting the total disbursal across 11 registered players to be to the tune of Rs 10 crore per month. Given the demand for credit and such a huge population of underserved consumers, the industry is just waiting to spread its wings.“We are already disbursing around Rs 2 crore per month and by March 2019 we intend to reach ?5 crore, we have even received interest from banks who intend to partner us as well,” said Amit More, CEO of Mumbai-based Finzy. The startup has raised ?18 crore over a seed and a series-A round from multiple investors.Like Finzy, multiple platforms have had discussions with banks so that they could also lend through the platforms, but the RBI’s rule to limit borrower’s exposure to Rs 10 lakh has been a dampener, say P2P founders.“Banks and even family offices have gone slow on their partnership plans with us because ?10 lakh is too low a limit for them to consider this as a retail investment category, Rs 1 crore could be a starting point for them,” said a senior P2P lending industry executive.The P2P lending players have come together to form an industry association so that they can take care of common interests and reach out to the regulator in one voice. ET has learnt that the body has already had interactions with the central bank and is hoping to get the limits uplifted ‘soon’. The regulator, however, has not committed to any timeline or given any guarantees in this respect. With China throwing up so many cases of failed P2P lending startups, the Indian banking regulator has been extremely careful about the space and has always said that it wants it to grow slowly. “Scaling up at a rapid pace has been a challenge and I guess even the RBI understands that the industry could be in a turmoil if the limits are not raised,” said Dhiren Makhija, cofounder, Cashkumar, a Bengaluru-based P2P lending platform.","Jan 16, 2019, 04:18 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/red-tape-grounds-p2p-startups-as-investors-stay-clear-of-space/articleshow/67332449.cms
"Out of the patriarch's shadow, Stalin faces his first big test this year","In taking his party along during such testing weather, Stalin lacks the personal touch of the Kalaignar.","CHENNAI: MK Stalin was noticeably moved to tears in public twice in recent years. The first was at his anointment as the party’s working president amid DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi's failing health in early 2017. He broke down when senior party leader Durai Murugan borrowed the famous line - thambi vaa, thalaimai yerka vaa (come younger brother, take over the leadership) - which DMK founder CN Annadurai had used decades ago while handing over the leadership to Karunanidhi. The usually unflappable Stalin crumpled visibly, before announcing he was moving to the helm with a “heavy heart.”The second instance was four months ago on hearing the news that the court had allowed Karunanidhi to be buried alongside the grave of Annadurai, a coffin-side legal victory for the DMK against the rival AIADMK that came after tremendous drama. On both these occasions Stalin, who mostly sports a smile except during rare public displays of fury, showed a visceral commitment to the cause of the DMK and its beloved Kalaignar. Running a party founded on lofty ideals can be a weighty job, especially without the comforting shade of the towering patriarch. Nevertheless Stalin, in his own words, is a “trier.”Political analysts find Stalin earnest in taking forward Karunanidhi legacy, which is partly why he had managed to ward off threats from elder brother MK Alagiri and emerge the leader of the party. But electoral politics is widely seen as his Achilles heel . His decision to ally with the Congress in the 2016 Assembly polls was questioned after Jayalalithaa's AIADMK sailed to a second consecutive victory. And recently, in the RK Nagar bypoll following the death of Jayalalithaa, his candidate lost his deposit.N Sathiya Moorthy, political observer, says: “First and foremost, when it comes to alliance-formation and seat-sharing he has too many parties to accommodate. If DMK does not want them, they may join another front and cut into his votes. If he wins, it will be his arrival and acceptance statement. If he loses, critics will write his unholy epitaph. That could make it much more difficult for him in the even more critical Assembly polls of 2021.”After his father died, Stalin has been bold. Bold in announcing that his party was dead set against the BJP, which party insiders say was a calculated moved to demolish opinion that the DMK had a back channel going with the ruling party at the Centre. Also, bold in endorsing Rahul Gandhi as the prime-ministerial candidate at a time of great fluidity in electoral alliances. By repeatedly favouring the Congress, Stalin has taken the DMK several strides into the grand old party's camp at a time the rival AIADMK is looking ambivalent. But, in taking his party along during such testing weather, Stalin lacks the personal touch of the Kalaignar. ""There is criticism that he is inaccessible to the cadre, and even to functionaries,"" says Moorthy. ""Though Stalin has his own distinct approach, the hallmark quality often seen in Karunanidhi, which is apparently missing in MK Stalin, is the ability the manoeuvre during alliances.” Stalin did try to address this concern once with a month full of meetings. Stalin’s life has been full of political ironies . As a 14-year-old schoolboy, he campaigned against the Congress in 1967, when the party was thrown out of power in Tamil Nadu. Now, he is cheering for Rahul Gandhi. His party had benefited from actor Rajinikanth’s famed confrontation with Jayalalithaa in 1996, but now he will possibly face the Thalaivar across the battlefield . Tamil Nadu politics is in a flux following the fall of its two giant towers, and 2019 will show whether Stalin has managed to emerge from the shadows.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:03 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/out-of-the-patriarchs-shadow-stalin-faces-his-first-big-test-this-year/articleshow/67332503.cms

30 lakh people push for inclusion in Assam,"The deadline to file claims and objection for those who have been left out of the final draft ended on Monday, but NRC officials said they would get the final tally on Tuesday. ","An estimated 30 lakh people have filed their claims until December 30 to be included in the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the final draft of which had left out over 40 lakh applicants due to lack of credible documents. Authorities have also received around 600 objections to the inclusion of names on the list, published on July 30.

Taking positions on currency movements through futures,"An equity trading account with a brokerage firm is sufficient to access this segment.
","A previous classroom touched on the basics of equity futures and options. In this edition, ET provides the lowdown on exchange traded currency futures1. What are currency futures?Like equity futures and options, regulator SEBI, in consultation with RBI, has allowed registered and recognised exchanges like BSE and NSE to offer currency F&O. For simplicity’s sake we will focus on currency futures in this edition. A currency futures contract allows you to buy or sell a currency pair at a set price for delivery on a future date. The settlement happens in Indian rupees only.2. What are the products open to retail investors ?Futures contracts are available on the Dollar, British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen, each against the rupee. There are other cross currency futures as well.3. How can one trade?An equity trading account with a brokerage firm is sufficient to access this segment.4. How does it work?Say, you are bullish rupee and bearish dollar, you sell a dollar rupee futures contract or buy a dollar put option or sell a dollar call option. Assume you expect the dollar to weaken to 69.9 from 70.16, Friday’s last traded price. You sell the dollar-rupee futures expiring on January 29. The lot or contract size is $1,000. Say the dollar dips by 26 paise today to 69.9 at closing. You make 0.26×1,000 or Rs 260 per lot. If however, the dollar strengthens to say 70.4, you lose 0.24×1,000 or Rs 240 per lot. The same works for the other currency pairs, but dollar -rupee is the most active accounting for almost 90 per cent share of the four pairs versus rupee.5. How much exposure can a retail investor or trader take?In dollar-rupee, gross position shall not exceed 6 per cent of total open positions across all contracts, or $10 million, whichever is higher. In pairs like Euro and Pound, the exposure limit is 5 million euros or pounds and in Yen it is 200 million.6. How many contracts are liquid? The contract cycle is 12 months, but the most liquid is the front month contract . In the current case clients, can trade as far off as December 27, 2019 contract, but the most liquid is January 29, 2019 contract.7. How much margin does one have to pay? For one lot it is around 5 per cent but it changes if volatility increases. On the basis of January USDINR futures contract at 70.16, you put up a margin to trade of Rs 3,508.8. Who are the other participants in the currency futures segment?Banks, foreign portfolio investors and stock brokers who run proprietary books apart from HNIs and ultra HNIs.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:22 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/forex/taking-positions-on-currency-movements-through-futures/articleshow/67332602.cms
Angel tax continues to haunt startups,"About a week after the government sought to calm an agitated industry, the tax authorities have started issuing demand notices to startups to pay the angel tax by end-March.","MUMBAI/AHMEDABAD: The ghost of angel tax may continue to haunt startups for some time despite New Delhi’s assurances against potential coercive measures.About a week after the government sought to calm an agitated industry, the tax authorities have started issuing demand notices to startups to pay the angel tax by end-March.The latest notices specify the exact amount startups are required to pay along with the calculation of the taxes, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. ET spoke to startup promotors, who have received the tax demand orders over the past few days, and their tax advisors.Last week, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had issued a notice asking tax officers not to use “coercive measures” to recover the outstanding amount from the startups. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) is also looking into the angel tax issue and assured that the government would not harass the angel investors and startups.Tax experts point out that the government intervention means little now as tax officers had already served notices, and there was no option but to issue final demand notices by December 31. “The CBDT has only asked the revenue officers to refrain from taking coercive steps to recover the demand. This does not change the fact that demands continue to be raised and the issue itself is being litigated at various forums,” said Amit Maheshwari, Partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates.The demand notices had to come in before the deadline of December 31, and delayed notices could have been seen to be diluting the stand of the tax authorities.  The controversy surrounds the valuations during various rounds of startup funding. In several cases, the revenues at start-ups kept reducing or remained stagnant, but their valuations increased. The taxman is questioning the premiums paid by the investors and wants to categorise them as income that would be taxable at 30%.In most cases, the investments made by angel investors, venture capital funds or any other investor have been challenged by the taxman.Industry trackers say that last year, tax officers had even written to banks and attached the bank accounts of several start-ups. “Such coercive measures may not be taken this year,” said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.“As per instructions by CBDT…, the AO (assessment officer) cannot enforce the recovery of demand in these particular cases….The startups can challenge the demand with the commissioner (appeal) within 30 days of demand,” said Amit Singal, Co-Founder, Start-up Buddy Services, a Gurgram-based company that serves early-stage businesses.The tax department has started questioning the valuation experts. ET had on December 25 first reported that CAs and tax experts have been served notices for the methodology used in computing the valuation premiums for startups that often weren’t making any money.“Notices specifically mention disallowing the valuation done by VCs and their chartered accountants and ask (start-ups) to pay tax. But one has to get money from existing investors or it has to shut down,” said Munir Thakor, angel investor at Ahmedabad Angel Network (ANN).One of Thakor’s investee start-ups has recently received a demand notice from the IT authorities.Income-tax officers claim that the scrutiny on start-ups is mainly due to concerns over money laundering. “We are investigating if some of these investments were for converting black money (unaccounted money) to white (legal money). Why would someone pay a high amount in investments when the real value is much less?” a tax officer asked.According to insiders, the government may have to either amend the rules, or the notices to start-ups will continue. “A tax officer questioning a start-up’s valuation in one year cannot do otherwise the next year. This would mean that he’s not convinced of his own assessment,” said a person in the know.Tax experts are now hopeful that the government may seek to resolve the issue in the months to come, but that too may not have a retrospective effect on the angel tax controversy.“The government is looking into it and formed a committee especially for this issue and it seems that genuine start-ups can expect some relief from this draconian tax. Whether it will be retrospective to quash the existing litigation is a question that remains unanswered,” said Maheshwari.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:23 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/angel-tax-continues-to-haunt-startups/articleshow/67332582.cms

"As focus shifts to mandir, Ayodhya gets media centre","ET has seen a copy of the order issued by the UP govt on Dec14, sanctioning Rs 99.81 lakh for the project which envisages a new building with computers, LED televisions and rooms for accommodation for journalists.","The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has sanctioned nearly Rs 1 crore for setting up of an international media centre in Ayodhya, acceding to a longstanding demand in a city which is among its key areas of focus. ET has seen a copy of the order issued by the UP government on December 14, sanctioning Rs 99.81 lakh for the project which envisages a new building with computers, LED televisions and rooms for accommodation for journalists. “Ram Mandir issue is now much in news. Journalists from abroad and from across the country come to Ayodhya for coverage of the issue and they are expected in bigger number this year,” Mahendra Tripathi, President of the Ayodhya Press Club, told ET. “We had given a proposal to CM Yogi Adityanath for setting up a media centre and it has been sanctioned as an ‘International Media Centre’ with a budget of Rs 1crore.” He said the demand had been made since 1994 but successive chief ministers – Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav – ignored it. He said land for the project had been identified and construction is expected to begin on January 14. The Supreme Court will be hearing from January 4 the title suit for the land on which the temple of Lord Ram is proposed to be built. “The air-conditioned building will have rooms for accommodating journalists who come for coverage of news, clean toilets, food, plus paraphilia such as computers, printers, internet and LEDs,” said Tripathi. “Journalists who come from abroad or Delhi faced trouble in getting accommodation due to lack of quality hotels in Ayodhya.” The Ayodhya district magistrate will oversee the project while the Ayodhya Press Club will run the international media centre once it is ready, he said. Ayodhya has been a prime area of focus for the Adityanath government, which has renamed Faizabad district as Ayodhya and held the grand ‘Deepotsav’ in the city on the occasion of Diwali, attracting media attention.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:26 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/as-focus-shifts-to-mandir-ayodhya-gets-media-centre/articleshow/67332648.cms

Mamata Banerjee eyes wider horizons in 2019,Political analysts believe the TMC stalwart would let her cards unravel only after the 2019 numbers are out in the middle. ,"A large hoarding on one of the roadside pillars on Kolkata’s Eastern Metropolitan bypass, a few meters from Trinamool Congress headquarter, has a huge cutout of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee with a few lines of text in Bangla. It says, 'This time we want a Bengali prime minister: Our Didi Mamata Banerjee.' Not that there is anything new in these lines. Senior leaders of the party including Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee, who is the chief minister’s nephew, have already set out out the theme in public meetings. That Ma, Mati and Manush - the Trinamool trope meaning Mother, Motherland and People - want to see her as prime minister. The leader, however, has always maintained that her first priority is to ""bring democracy back"" to the country by ousting the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In recent tiimes, Banerjee remained one of the most vocal forces against Modi. In 2017- 18 she did it all. From travelling to Delhi to meet several Opposition leaders, to making an (failed) attempt to bring Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on board against Modi, to supporting JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy in the Karnataka election, to advising Akhilesh Yadav to ally with bitter rival Mayawati in the Uttar Pradesh bypolls - she has tried to be the pivot of Opposition unity. And, If sources here are to be believed, she was the one who convinced the JDS to jointly stake claim with the Congress in Karnataka after the BJP there landed just short of a majority. Kolkata during the time also became the favoured port of call for Opposition forces. Aspiring kingmakers N Chandrababu Naidu and K Chandrashekar Rao both tried to enlist her support, Gujarat's Patidar leader Hardik Patel compared her to the lion-hearted Indira Gandhi and promised to campaign for her in 2019. The Trinamool chief is yet to fully reveal her cards. For those wishing to second guess them, here are signs: She attended the swearing-in ceremony in Karnataka, where bigger partner Congress let Kumaraswamy become chief minister; but was absent in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where Congress formed a government which included non-BJP parties as minor allies.Banerjee, to her credit, escalated the big fight against Modi sarkar even before many others were off the blocks. She marched on the streets of Delhi and complained to the President about the ""economic chaos"" unleased by demonestisation. She also demonstrated vociferously against the ""hasty implementation"" of the Goods and Services Tax. If both these issues got her an audience outside Bengal, closer home she joined issue with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) of Assam, calling it ""anti-Bengali"". Over the last two months, she picked up no less than a dozen confrontations against the Centre, casting herself in the familiar role of a feisty street-fighter against a powerful adversary.The recent Congress resurgence in the Hindi hearltland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh has somewhat plateaued her trajectory as the pivot of anti-BJP forces. But it has by no means ended it. She has planned a grand rally of anti-BJP parties in Kolkata’s fabled Brigade ground on January 19 - a show of strength aimed at not just the BJP. Political analysts believe the TMC stalwart would let her cards unravel only after the 2019 numbers are out in the middle. Senior Trinamool leaders point out that, for instance, during an hour-long meeting with KCR recently Banerjee did not once give away her national plans. “Didi has been saying for long that all parties should fight with all their strength in the regions where they are stronger forces. And the alliance or leader of the alliance or the PM candidate can be decided post result. In this scenario, there is no scope of any pre-poll alliance,"" says a senior leader close to the CM. Hence, her party was the first to express reservation over DMK leader MK Stalin’s proposal to project Congress president Rahul Gandhi as the PM face of the Opposition. She received support from other regional parties as well. Despite being among the first to try bring all anti-BJP parties across the country on to a single platform, she was also among the first to realise the amorphousness of a pre-poll national alliance.Her Delhi foray may not have been particularly successful so far, but it has not gone to waste either. With the 2019 game seeming more open, Banerjee knows a reinvigorated Congress would considerably reduce her bargaining power . But that has not stopped her from eyeing the horizon to her west. She would continue to take on the Centre on various issues , taking along likeminded friends from across the country.And , in the meanwhile, continue to practise her Hindi as well.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:32 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/mamata-banerjee-eyes-wider-horizons-in-2019/articleshow/67332728.cms

Invesco India Tax Fund : Fund Review,"Among tax-exempt investments,ELSS has the shortest lock-in period of three years.","It is that time of the year when one submits proofs of investments for tax exemption under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, which makes it necessary to look at some Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS). There are several advantages of investing in ELSS. Among tax-exempt investments, it has the shortest lock-in period of three years. The Public Provident Fund (PPF) and National Savings Certificate (NSC) have lock-in periods of 15 years and six years, respectively. Tax-free fixed deposits in banks are locked-in for five years.ELSS is an equity product, which helps the investor gain better returns in the long term as compared to the other alternatives. Given these factors, it makes sense to opt for ELSS for conservative investors. Among various schemes, investors can consider Invesco India Tax Plan. The scheme is it follows multi-cap strategy. Fund managers Amit Ganatra and Dhimant Kothari have maintained a ratio of 60:40 exposure large-caps and other stocks. This multicap approach has been a key factor in the scheme’s consistent performance in almost all market cycles.In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 11% and 17% returns while its benchmark BSE 200 index has given 12% and 15% returns in the same period, respectively. In general, ELSS schemes on an average have given 10% and 15% returns in the past three-year and five-year periods respectively.In the past six months, the fund managers have enhanced exposure to well-established companies which have been attractive due to two reasons: strong business model (demand in the sector, high cashflows) and fall in markets. These companies are Bajaj Finance, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises.Expert TakeHARSHVARDHAN ROONGTA, CFP, Roongta SecuritiesThis scheme is suitable for investors looking at a conservative equity portfolio with predominantly large-cap companies available at reasonable valuations. In volatile markets such investment approach is expected to provide some cushion to investor anxiety. Being an ELSS fund, there is a lock in of three years, however, investors should select equity investments with a time horizon of at least 5-7 years.

PSBs lack adequate risk mitigation measures,"Between 2015 and 2018, PSBs accounted for 90% of all frauds that happened in banking sector
","MUMBAI: Public sector banks are lacking adequate risk mitigation measures to counter increasing fraudulent activities as these banks continue to remain the major victims of frauds in the banking system over the past four years, said the RBI in its Financial Stability Report.Between fiscal years 2015 and 2018, PSBs accounted for 90 per cent of all frauds that happened in the banking sector, according to data from the central bank.“Operational risks in the banking sector have assumed significance of late, calling for reforms in governance and board oversight structures and overhaul of the extant risk culture in banks,” RBI said in the report.Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Punjab   moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.

The assessment and inculcation of appropriate risk culture in an organisational milieu assumes importance in this regard,” it said. The report also pointed that the 11 public sector banks, which are under the central bank’s prompt corrective action (PCA) umbrella, accounted for 36 per cent of the fraudulent cases despite having just 18.9 per cent share of risk weighted assets for operational risk. “Given the relatively high susceptibility of PSBs to operational risk, the relative capitalisation of such banks with regards to operational risk becomes relevant… A more judicious alignment of realised operational risk with allocated capital, specifically with regards to PCA-PSBs, is desirable,” RBI said.The report also showed that in recent years there has been a marked rise in the number of large frauds (worth over Rs 1 lakh). The number of large frauds in 2017-18 rose to 5,917 amounting to Rs 41,167 crore from 4,306 such cases worth Rs 10,170.8 crore in 2013-14.  For the first half of financial year 2018-19, a total of 3,416 large frauds worth Rs 30,420.2 crore have been reported.The biggest fraud in the Indian banking history came to light in February 2018 with now-absconding jeweller duo Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi found having duped Punjab National Bank of around Rs 13,000 crore.

When the Mayawati-Akhilesh bond will be put to the big test,Both the major players in Uttar Pradesh- BSP and SP- are in regular touch to avoid conflict.,"NEW DELHI: In 2019, difficult challenges are in store for BSP chief Mayawati who has so far preferred to keep her cards close to her chest.Although she is no longer averse to the idea of joining hands with other political parties against the BJP, she has made it a top priority to first retain her party’s support base in UP.Most of the BSP leaders see the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as an opportunity for their chief to emerge as a key political player in the national scenario. So, Mayawati’s first concern would be to ensure her party’s good show in the coming 2019 LS polls. “If you get elected at least 35 MPs, you may become a key player in the national politics after the 2019 LS polls,” a source in BSP explained the party’s strategy for the 2019 LS polls.The BSP camp would love to see a situation in which no party touches the magic figure to form the next government at the Centre on its own. The advantage for the party is that it has the capacity to get transfer its votes to a partner, if any, making it a formidable ally. Ahead of the 2019 poll, Mayawati has almost finished her homework well for her party. After resigning from the Rajya Sabha in July 2017, she had held a series of rallies in different parts of Uttar Pradesh, apparently as an exercise to gauge the mood of cadres after the disastrous show in the 2017 state poll. “She collected feedback about her party at the ground level and then started focussing on the chances of alliance with the SP,” a source in BSP recalled his party’s silent support to SP and RLD candidates in the recent by-polls for Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana Lok Sabha seats. The BSP never contests by-polls. “So, the by-polls for Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana showed its capacity to transfer its base votes in favour of SP candidates,” the source further added. Sources said leaders of both the major players in Uttar Pradesh- BSP and SP- are in regular touch to avoid conflict, if any, between their cadres at the ground level. “Both the parties - SP and BSP- are interested in sending out a positive message about a possible alliance between them at the ground level,” another source in the BSP said.BSP leaders are hopeful that the SP national president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav might back Mayawati’s bid for Prime Ministership after the 2019 polls. “It is also in the interest of SP chief Akhilesh to see BSP national president Mayawati as a key player in the national politics after the polls. He has a long career in politics and he understands his exact political role in the current phase of politics,” the source said. However, the BSP’s relation with the Congress in UP still remains a moot point. “Behanji’s first priority is to retain her support base and thus, she may not go a long way to oblige the Congress, at least in UP,” another source in BSP felt.

Positives for India in its backyard but China’s leverage unmatched,"Taking into account the growing power asymmetry with China, the dangerous confrontation at Doklam at the India-Bhutan-China border, in 2017 gave way to a more nuanced policy in 2018.","By SHYAM SARAN2018 has not been an easy year to manage. India has struggled to adjust to an increasingly polarized world with US-China relations entering a phase of open and probably irreversible confrontation. Russia’s growing closeness to China is a further complication. India’s immediate neighbourhood has become a zone of contestation with China’s profile expanding. The continuing and undiminished turmoil in the Gulf and West Asia put at risk India’s energy security and the welfare of its more than six million citizens living and working in the region. Given these trends, how did India fare in the year gone by? Taking into account the growing power asymmetry with China, the dangerous confrontation at Doklam at the India-Bhutan-China border, in 2017 gave way to a more nuanced policy in 2018. There was a return to the earlier more cautious stance on the Tibet issue. The public association of government figures with functionaries of the Tibet government in exile (which India does not recognise) came to an end. The sharply critical rhetoric on China’s Belt and Road Initiative became muted as did the loud complaints over Chinese opposition to India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. China, for its part, welcomed India into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, offered a few trade concessions and projected a more benign and congruent relationship even though in substance, the relationship remains adversarial. China’s security and economic relationship with Pakistan stands undiminished. It continues to seek enhanced influence in Nepal and is maintaining pressure on Bhutan to settle the boundary on terms it has already offered, exchange embassies and open border trade. Recent political changes in Sri Lanka and the Maldives appear favourable to India, but China’s economic leverage remains unmatched. The return of Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister of Bangladesh in just concluded elections must have been received with a sense of relief but concerns over China’s growing economic and military profile in a strategically important neighbour will remain. India is yet to articulate an effective neighbourhood policy which draws on substantive and long-term leverage and economic inter-dependency. This remains a structural constraint. In the Indian Ocean, Chinese naval presence, its establishment of base facilities or logistical hubs across the littoral, mean that there are now many more potential points of contention with India. So where does the Wuhan spirit fit into all this? The answer is to be found in China’s need to keep its western flank neutralised while it copes with a more aggressive and openly adversarial United States. This has given India a tactical opening and it is to the credit of our foreign policy managers that they have taken advantage of it. As long as its tactical nature and hence, ephemerality is recognised, having greater room for manoeuvre is welcome. The more enduring challenges remain and only a sustained effort to reduce the asymmetry of power with China will enable their resolution. Even though the geopolitical relation landscape is heading towards greater polarisation, India’s interests at this time are best served by avoiding overt alignment with either of the emerging poles. India did well to retain its equities in its relationship with Iran, going ahead with the strategically important Chahbahar port. It has kept Russia in a relatively benign mood through the purchase of the S-400 missile system while fending off US sanctions by leveraging its growing defence hardware relationship with the US and in expanding maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the most important theatre for the US.Given Trump’s unpredictability this may unravel in the New Year but so far so good. Prime Minister Modi did a trilateral with Trump and the Japanese PM Abe on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in November and followed it up with a trilateral with Russia’s Putin and China’s Xi Jinping. This is a visible manifestation of Non-Alignment 2.0 but in a different place and time. By projecting India as a swing state courted by the great powers the country has expanded its diplomatic space. But going forward, if the asymmetry of power with China remains unaddressed, India will move closer to the countervailing coalition represented by the “Quad” and including the US, Japan and Australia at the core.The Gulf and West Asia has now acquired a salience in our foreign policy which was long overdue given the significance of the region to our interests. There has been a perceptible and deliberate enhancement of our relations with the oil rich kingdoms as well as Iran and Israel, countries at opposite ends of the spectrum. This will stand us in good stead if a crisis does erupt in what remains a volatile region. Indian foreign policy did not display the same tactical flexibility in its dealings with Pakistan. Despite some risks involved, India should have explored opportunities for engaging its new leadership. Pakistan is grappling with a fundamental change in its strategic environment. Since the 1960s, Pakistan has enjoyed two strong pillars of support in China and the US. Even in periods of intense confrontation between them, China has never objected to US military and economic support for Pakistan. Similarly, the US has welcomed Chinese support to Pakistan. This enabled Pakistan to maintain a balanced relationship with its two patrons even while pursuing hostile policies towards India. With Trump, the American pillar has become shaky and Pakistan’s resultant over-dependence on China must cause discomfort even among the Pakistani military. This could be an opening for India. Instead Pakistan has put India on the defensive with its opening of the Kartarpur corridor. This is a minus on the scorecard. The intense preoccupation with the forthcoming general elections will inevitably deflect attention from foreign policy in the year ahead. For the major parties in contention there should be a more than just rhetorical focus on India’s external relations in their manifestos. For the first time since India adopted economic reforms and liberalisation in the early 1990s, and which enabled a more outward looking and expansive foreign policy, there are signs that this virtuous parallelism has run its course. A more insular economy, whose signs are unmistakeable, cannot support an enhanced engagement with our region and the world. This disconnect will haunt us more and more as we head into the next decade of this millennium.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:41 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/positives-for-india-in-its-backyard-but-chinas-leverage-unmatched/articleshow/67332771.cms
Cable TV networks may take internet services to homes in remote areas,,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: With an aim to ramp up broadband connectivity to the farthest reaches of the country, the ministry of information and broadcasting and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India have revived a proposal to provide broadband services through existing cable networks. The move has the potential, ministry officials said, to provide instant internet connectivity to nearly 19 crore households that have television sets, of which about 10 crore homes already have cable TV subscription. At a recently held deliberation with cable operators from across the country, Trai chairman R S Sharma also said that such a move can increase internet connectivity through fixed line networks from the existing 7%, against the global average of 46%. At the consumers’ end, the transition to broadband, along with cable TV services, will happen through a simple migration to a new set top box. At the service providers’ end, technology integration for both cable and broadband services will be facilitated by the ministry’s engineering arm- BECIL. The sticking point, however, remains the 8% Annual General Revenue (AGR) — the payment that cable operators currently pay to the department of telecom — and whether, once this transition is made, it should only be paid for the broadband services, or for the overall revenue generated from both businesses. Apart from concerns over licensing, there is an apprehension among cable operators that paying AGR on total revenue generated from both businesses may impact their bottom lines. Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesDuring the mid-December meeting of the ministry and TRAI with service providers, Sharma also cited the instance of South Korea, which has implemented a similar proposal and has offered an AGR waiver to its cable service providers, as a result of which internet connectivity through fixed line networks in the country is pegged at 93%. Sources in the government said that the ministry and cable operators are both keen on seeing the proposal being implemented. The government has also assured cable operators that no specific technology will be imposed on service operators for providing broadband services through cable networks. I&B secretary Amit Khare also said that the cable TV and broadband businesses should be treated as separate and that only revenue generated through the supply of broadband services should be taxed. For it to be implemented, the proposal will now be whetted on the financial implications of a likely AGR waiver. But with both the government and service providers on board, it is likely to see the light of day.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:44 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/cable-tv-networks-may-take-internet-services-to-homes-in-remote-areas/articleshow/67332820.cms

Investment strategy for election year? Just don't think too much,I will not hazard a guess on what the market will be like in 2019 says Basumallick.,"Calendar 2018 was a very testing year for Dalal Street. Investors in midcaps and smallcaps bled profusely. Largecaps, with the exception of a handful of stocks, have also gone down. This is normal. Equity returns are not linear. Equity as an asset class does not give steady, regular returns.Calendar 2017 was a year of super-normal profits. On a two-year timeframe, investors have still made positive returns. It is the recency effect and the availability bias which play their tricks with our minds and make us feel that the market has let us down!I will not hazard a guess on what the market will be like in 2019. Not because I don’t want to, but simply because I don’t know how to. I know at this time of the year, it is fashionable and probably expected to prognosticate about the next year, but I will refrain from that.Instead let me talk about a few important things that we should keep our eyes out for.First, let’s talk about the elephant in the room and get it out of the way - the general elections. Historically, Indian market has had large swings immediately before or after the general elections.However, if we have a two-year view, elections and their results don’t matter much. In 2004, Nifty went circuit down post-elections, and yet the market went on to have a great bull rally for the next three years.Exactly, the opposite happened in 2009. The market went circuit up and then did not do much for the next two years.In the US elections, when Trump won, markets were expected to crash, yet they rallied. Recently, in the state elections, the ruling party lost in three major states, yet the market went up instead of falling as was generally expected.I would argue that not only is it not possible to figure out election results, but it is not important to do so for investing.Next is the US-China trade war. It is something which is too difficult and complicated to be able to infer the implications. One thing in India’s favour is that most of India’s economy is domestic consumption-driven and not dependent on either the US or China.Oil prices can destabilise our economy to a great extent. How they behave in 2019 and beyond needs to be on our radar as investors, because they can impact the currency and interest rates. We, as a nation, need to start actively looking at renewables and at reducing our dependence on oil imports. Calendar 2019 is a year as good as any to get started on this.Job creation in the age of increasing automation is going to be an ongoing challenge. India needs to be able to support its huge population with jobs. We are in a peculiar situation with scarcity at both ends of the spectrum. Industry doyens keep talking about unavailability of employable people. On the other hand, our youths have no jobs. Should we be focusing on vocational training instead of trying to push everyone to get a graduation degree? What about the quality of education being imparted at various levels?While these have nothing directly to do with equity investing in 2019, tackling these problems by an enterprise can provide long-term mega-themes.India is a $2.5 trillion economy today. At the current pace, we should double in 8-9 years and then double again in another 8-9 years. In this while, the market cap should also go up substantially from current levels, because a lot more of the large unlisted players would come to the capital markets through IPOs.At a 100% market cap-to-GDP ratio, we are looking at an approximately $10 trillion market cap in 16 to 18 years. That is a five-fold rise at market level in this time frame. Individual stocks will definitely do much better. So, keep an eye for longer-term wealth creation stories, be invested in a well-chosen portfolio of stocks and fasten your seat belts for a bumpy ride.","Jan 01, 2019, 10:55 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/investment-strategy-for-election-year-just-dont-think-too-much/articleshow/67332949.cms
Chennai Metro gets ‘Make in India’ push from Japan,"After several rounds of meeting between the urban affairs secretary and Japanese ambassador, both sides agreed to push the manufacturing of rolling stock in India for the Chennai Metro project. ","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: In a first, the government has brought Japanese funding agency, JICA, on board to ensure that three-fourth of Metro rail coaches to be supplied by Japanese companies are manufactured in India. The Japanese firms can either set up their own plants here to produce the coaches or collaborate with Indian firms.This agreement has been signed with JICA for funding of the second phase of Chennai Metro project. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will extend Rs 20,196 crore for the project. The agreement is being seen as a positive signal for proposing similar arrangement for future Metro and other rail projects to push the ‘Make in India’ initiative.TOI has learnt that after several rounds of meeting between the urban affairs secretary and Japanese ambassador, both sides agreed to push the manufacturing of rolling stock in India for the Chennai Metro project. “It was decided that the Japanese side will encourage Japanese rolling stock manufacturers to promote assembly in India, thereby achieving cost reduction based on the recently awarded rates, and enable 75% of coaches to be manufactured in India either through collaboration or by setting up of an independent manufacturing unit,” said the minutes of the latest meeting. As per the agreement, the Indian side will share the recently awarded rates of rolling stock with the Japanese side, which would be shared with their rolling stock manufacturers.","Jan 01, 2019, 11:05 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/chennai-metro-gets-make-in-india-push-from-japan/articleshow/67332853.cms
Mumbai man to steer Nasa's historic flyby,,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)LAURAL (MARYLAND): Mumbai will have its footprint on Nasa's New Horizon spacecraft's trajectory while executing a nail-biting historic flyby of the most distant and ancient object in the solar system, Ultima Thule, around 11am (IST) on Tuesday. The reason: the person who is playing a key role in navigating the spacecraft to this object, discovered just four years ago, is a Mumbaikar.  Shyam Bhaskaran of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was born in 1963 at a clinic in Matunga. Bhaskaran, who has navigated a number of Nasa missions, spoke to TOI on Sunday, recalling that he stayed at Kenilworth, Pedder Road, which housed officials of the department of atomic energy. Bhaskaran, who attended preschool at Kemps Corner, said he remembered playing with friends in and around Kenilworth. ""I had a tricycle and I used to pedal it around the area."" He left for the US in 1968, but returned to Mumbai in 1981 to meet relatives. ""I found it was a really big city, full of life and crowded. I will certainly revisit in the future,"" he said. About the challenges involved in navigating the mission, he said that compared to the flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, Ultima Thule which is nearly six billion km from Pluto, was easier since there were no objects around. ""But it was not without challenge because we have never done such an encounter of an object which was unknown, small and dark. Finding the object is difficult,"" he explained. Ultima Thule is a traditional name of distant places beyond the known world.  On January 1, the New Horizons spacecraft will be flying 3,500 km above the surface of Ultima Thule. This distance is three times closer to how far it was from Pluto.  Bhaskaran said that at 4am on Sunday, the navigation team, after a meeting, concluded that with regards to navigating the spacecraft, everything looked good.

Sebi move on derivatives good for long-term investors: Deven Choksey,"
Bajaj Auto an exception in two-wheeler space because they have advantage of higher exports, says Choksey","We would have to wait for at least a month or so before which we start seeing actual rise in the demand for autos followed by clearance of the inventory, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Edited excerpts:  Yesterday, Sebi issued a circular saying that derivatives need be settled physically now. You have argued in the past that it is high time that end of the market gets fixed. If you have to simplify this for our viewers, what does it mean? This is a long-awaited measure from Sebi and it has powerful indication. I am not aware of the fine line but my reading says that unless you clear the market lot system out of this particular derivative market, even the delivery settle derivative market will not be helpful to the market in general. It will end up extending volatility. Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Bajaj Auto Ltd  moved up by 1 in 3 months on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis » On one side you are forcing people to continuously operate on a minimum market lot size and that too, you want to take to higher levels of 5 lakhs and 10 lakhs eventually. This unnecessarily creates too much of pressure and the volatility including the rollovers during which you see the sharp increase in volumes and which are not genuine volume.  Currently, on a cash market turnover to the derivative market turnover ratio, India markets are probably trading at the highest level in the world economy and even if you convert the delivery base volume to the derivative market turnover, we will remain amongst the highest in the world. So from that perspective, we should be considered one of the most speculative markets in the world as far the derivative contract goes. That is where delivery settle derivative would take place. Typically, genuine investors, the long-only portfolio investors like mutual fund, PMS, insurance companies, pension funds. HNIs would probably try and get the advantage of delivery settle market.  Whenever they will have the position working for them on the hedge side or the on the leverage side, probably delivery settle derivative market would work favourably. Over a period of time, should they bring down or remove the market lots, then probably even the volatility into the market would significantly come down. That is where you will see the true market emerging here after. I am really hopeful and want to read the scheme of things before making any specific comment on the subject. But this is a welcome move from the perspective of long-term investors.ET Now: Soon we will have the auto sales numbers as well for the month of December trickle in. Do you think there could be a marked recovery this time? Deven Choksey: As we understand from various companies, the inventory position in the December-ended quarter, has remained as an overhang for the industry in general. We have been talking about the inventory positions of the likes of Maruti. We have been talking about inventory positions coming in from even the two-wheeler companies and that is the area where you would like to play little bit safe at this point of time. The spill-over of the inventory is likely to happen from December ended quarter to January-March quarter, wherein we are likely to see the discount increasing and clearance of the inventory taking place in this particular quarter. Should that be the situation, then probably we will have to wait for a couple of months before seeing an actual rise in demand. Auto companies offtake would improve once they go closer to the election day when they start seeing the larger amount of offtake for all range of vehicles starting with the commercial vehicles and going up to two-wheelers. We would have to wait for at least a month or so before which we start seeing the actual rise in the demand followed by clearance of the inventoryBut till that point of time, December ended quarter as well as the beginning of January to March quarter 2019, we are likely to see the overhang of the higher inventory in the auto space and that is where we will have to play little bit more careful in buying the stock. Companies like Bajaj Auto could be an exception in two-wheeler space largely because they have the advantage of higher exports and better realisation due to the rupee value and also at the same time, the company has been systematically cornering some of the entry level market share and their higher range of motorcycles have continued to command relatively stable market share in this environment as well. So the likes of Bajaj Auto will be a differentiator but otherwise more or less we will see the overhang of the higher inventory for majority of the auto companies in this particular quarter.

A better way would be to identify your various financial goals, and choose schemes to achieve those goals. You cannot invest in high-risk equity mutual fund schemes like midcap schemes and smallcap schemes with an investment horizon of just five years.

Govt may take big banking decisions before 2019 polls,On the cards is a decision on transfer of surplus funds by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the government.,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)MUMBAI: For banks, the last quarter of the financial year is usually time for consolidation rather than change. This is the time when they go full throttle on lending and beef up their top line before closing their books for the year. The year 2019 will, however, see a lot of front-ending of events in the private sector and also among state-owned lenders as the government is likely to push through some key decisions ahead of the elections.On the cards is a decision on transfer of surplus funds by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the government. This is likely to follow the report of the Bimal Jalan-led committee, which is expected before end-March 2019. The government is simultaneously going full-steam ahead on its decision to consolidate the three public sector banks — Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. Management consultancy firm EY has already been appointed to help in the process.The other major M&A activity in the public sector that will conclude in the first quarter of 2019 will be LIC’s acquisition of IDBI Bank. LIC has said that it will pay shareholders who respond to its open offer for purchase of IDBI Bank stock on December 31. This means that the process will be completed in the third quarter. LIC’s acquisition, through infusion of fresh capital, will bring IDBI Bank out of RBI’s prompt corrective action plan. LIC plans to professionalise IDBI Bank on the lines of Axis Bank. Others Additionally, the fourth quarter is when SBI’s mega qualified institutional placement of equity shares is expected. SBI aims to raise Rs 20,000 crore as it prepares itself for a surge in lending in 2019.Early 2019 will also see the conclusion of the last chapter in the high drama in several private banks. Justice B N Srikrishna, who is looking into the conflict of interest allegations at ICICI Bank, is expected to submit his report in the coming weeks. This will put an end to the controversy in the bank, which culminated in the resignation of Chanda Kochhar. In Kotak Bank, the Bombay high court will decide on the lender’s plea to retain its promoter’s shareholding at above 20%. Kotak Bank has filed a writ petition challenging the central bank’s order to dilute promoter holding to 20%. The new year will be the most eventful for Yes Bank where the lender’s founder, promoter and CEO Rana Kapoor is expected to step down in January 2019 and make way for a new chief executive. The year is also likely to see a truce between the two promoter group’s Rana Kapoor and his sister-in-law Madhu Kapur who have been fighting in courts over the right to appoint directors. Axis Bank will also see a new beginning with newly-appointed CEO Amitabh Chaudhury taking charge from January 1 in place of Shikha Sharma who completes her term in December.","Jan 01, 2019, 05:31 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/govt-may-take-big-banking-decisions-before-2019-polls/articleshow/67332909.cms

Over dozen CPSEs evince interest in raising funds via debt ETF next fiscal,Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had in 2018-19 budget announced coming out with a debt ETF.,"NEW DELHI: Over a dozen CPSEs have evinced interest in raising funds through the finance ministry's maiden debt exchange-traded fund (ETF) to meet part of their capital expenditure needs next fiscal, an official said. To start with, the finance ministry will provide a platform for only 'AAA' and 'AA' rated Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) to raise funds by way of bond issuance using the debt ETF route. ""As many as 10-15 CPSEs have shown interest to try the debt ETF route for fund raising in next fiscal. These would be 'AAA' or AA' rated companies. The bonds would have varying tenure of two, three or five years,"" an official told . Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had in 2018-19 budget announced coming out with a debt ETF, following the success of equity ETFs like CPSE ETF and Bharat-22 ETF. To give effect to this, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) is in the process of appointing mutual funds or asset management companies (AMCs) for creating, managing and launching a debt ETF. While inviting bids from AMCs, the finance ministry has said the public sector banks (PSBs) can also raise funds through the debt ETF route. The official, however, said that the PSBs would not initially raise funds using this route. The debt ETF would help these state-run companies meet the capex and business needs by leveraging their aggregate strength. This will bring enhanced liquidity, investors base and transparency of the participating CPSEs. ""The CPSEs are also interested to see if the fund raising through debt ETF would lower their borrowing cost. The AMC will decide which CPSEs should be clubbed in the ETF for lowering the cost,"" the official added. In India, the corporate bond market constitutes a relatively small size of around 13 per cent in terms of the GDP as compared to the government bond market, which is around 30.4 per cent in terms of the GDP. The debt market consists of the G-Sec market and the corporate debt market. The G-Secs accounts for 79 per cent of the total amount of outstanding bonds in India.

How to fix our inverted public health pyramid,Studies show that more than 50% of patients at tertiary centres are only in need of primary care. ,"By Ruha ShadabEver wondered why our government hospitals look like homeless shelters? Why are there so many people sleeping in their corridors? Do we have too few hospitals? Or too few doctors? The reasons are aplenty; one of the main ones is the poor realisation of a theoretically sound policy.India’s current public health set-up is often traced to the Bhore committee of 1946. The committee’s continued relevance signifies its foresight, and our inability to achieve its recommendations. For instance, it recommended setting up 75-bedded hospitals for a population of 10,000 to 20,000. The bed to population ratio, 70 years later, is 9 per 10,000.The three-tiered government health centre model that forms the core of the National Health Mission (NHM), has evolved from the committee’s recommendations. There is a base of sub-centres (SC; covering 3,000 to 5,000 people) and primary health centres (PHC; covering 20,000 to 30,000 people) which are the first points of contact for the patient with the government health system. These centres are capable of a basic set of services, which includes conducting normal (vaginal) deliveries.If the patient’s needs are beyond the services available, she is referred to a higher centre which houses specialists. These community health centres (CHC) cover 80,000 to 1,20,000 people, and have a physician, a gynaecologist, a surgeon, and a paediatrician. For even more complicated procedures and diseases, the patient is further referred to district hospitals (DH; also called tertiary centres). This system of graded care with referral linkages helps to bring health and medical care close to a patient’s home and ensures timely treatment.The network of this infrastructure comprises 1.5 lakh SC, 25,000 PHC, 5,600 CHC and 760 DH. This still falls short of the population norms mentioned above, by 19-30%. While the brick-and-mortar gap should be plugged, it is worthwhile to take stock of whether these 2 lakh institutions are working efficiently. If they were, our public health pyramid would not currently be balancing on its tip.Studies show that more than 50% of patients at tertiary centres are only in need of primary care. One can also use this inverted pyramid to partially explain why so many patients choose to visit quacks, euphemistically referred to as rural medical practitioners (abbreviated as RMP, which is also the abbreviation for legitimate medical doctors: registered medical practitioners). The latest round of National Family Health Survey 2015-16 which had a sample of 5.7 lakh households, shows that the most common reasons for non-availing of services at government health centres are poor quality of services, no nearby health facility, and long waiting lines.To address these issues, firstly, the public healthcare system in India needs to build a reputation for credibility. SCs are being transformed to health and wellness centres (HWCs) under the Ayushmaan Bharat programme. This transformation will entail a reorientation of SC from beyond the historic focus on reproductive and child health (deliveries, immunisation, childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia) to include non-communicable diseases, oral health, emergency medical care, etc. Measures to improve service delivery and not merely expanding its ambit are critical. A strong foundation of first-point-ofcontact centres will lessen the burden on specialist hospitals where much time and money are wasted.Secondly, a humble acknowledgement of the limitations of the public healthcare sector needs to be made and an assessment of the complementarities of the private sector should be done. While Niti Aayog has been encouraging states to take up a PPP model for setting up hospitals, the regulatory environment must also incentivise more single doctor clinics to plug the rural-urban inequality.Thirdly, technology has been tested to improve access and its quality. Tata Trusts and the Karnataka government put forth the ‘Digital Nerve Centre’ which merges the last two suggestions. It uses tele-medicine, video-conferencing and e-appointments systems to improve patients’ experience. While there may be limitations in its scalability, such innovative interventions need to be tried out across the country.With government spending on health stagnating at 1% of GDP, capacity building of the existing institutional framework will be a challenge. Much hinges on creating an ecosystem of partnership and innovation which brings to the fore a renewed vigour for improving India’s healthcare system.(The writer is a research scholar at Harvard University)","Jan 01, 2019, 10:58 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/how-to-fix-our-inverted-public-health-pyramid/articleshow/67332933.cms

Top fashion brands stare at uncertain future online,Most of these brands have been created in-house by these internet companies or have come to India as a result of exclusive arrangements with them.,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: Top fashion and sportswear brands — including Under Armour, Mango, Roadster and HRX — that have exclusive arrangements with online marketplaces are staring at an uncertain future after the government announced curbs on FDI in e-commerce companies.Most of these brands have been created in-house by these internet companies or have come to India as a result of exclusive arrangements with them. US sportswear brand Under Armour, for example, sells its products only on Amazon India, while industry experts pegged the sales of Myntra’s in-house fashion label Roadster between Rs 300 crore and Rs 400 crore.“The government said that these e-commerce companies will not be allowed to enter into exclusive agreements with sellers,” said the MD of a top international fashion retailer. “So, what will happen to these online-only brands?”The apparel and footwear category is the second-most penetrated in Indian e-commerce (9% of total retail sales) with total online sales of $5 billion in 2017. In comparison, total online sales of consumer electronics, the category with the highest online penetration (17%), was pegged at $4.5 billion by Bain & Co.He went on to explain how an exclusive arrangement works. “In the case of Under Armour, for example, the company would not want to spend on opening an office or stores here and so would have decided to sell only through Amazon. In return, Amazon would have committed a particular amount as business to the brand,” he said.In a similar arrangement, brands such as Dorothy Perkins, Mango and Forever21are available online only on Myntra and Jabong. Indian cricketer Virat Kohli’s fashion brand Wrogn and Bollywood superstar Hrithik Roshan’s athleisure brand HRX are exclusive to Myntra. In addition, there are several other smaller brands such as Breakbounce, which grew on the back of support from these e-tailers.The government has also barred e-commerce companies, Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, from selling products from companies in which they have a stake. “This move will hurt the entire online fashion business which was growing at a brisk pace,” said a CEO at a large fashion retailer. “Online fashion sales are controlled by large vendors because the smaller ones don’t have the bandwidth to pick up huge stock. And most of e-tailers have an interest in these vendors because otherwise who would have borne the discounts.”","Jan 01, 2019, 11:03 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fashion-/-cosmetics-/-jewellery/top-fashion-brands-stare-at-uncertain-future-online/articleshow/67332982.cms

Attention, Men! Here's The Ultimate Shoe-Care Guide This SummerAutoplay1 of 9Invest In Good Shoe-Care ProductsTaking care of your leather and suede shoes can get cumbersome. It is extremely important to invest in good shoe-care products like brush, spray, polish, etc. to increase the life of your footwear.Synthetics/vegan options (also called as suede) are best for summer season as they are naturally water-resistant, light and absorb sweat. Shop for natural materials such as faux leather, cotton or canvas more than synthetic uppers. These fabrics help your feet breathe easy and stay comfortable in the summer heat.Here are some vauable tips from Ayush Diwan Khurana, founder and designer of Modello Domani, Prem Dewan, Retail Head at OSL Luxury Collections Corneliani, and Saggar Mehra, Creative Director at Sunil Mehra.Suede ErasersThe dust, dirt or dry stains on suedes can be removed using suede erasers that are designed especially for this particular type of leather. Use cornstarch to diminish oil stains on suedes. Don't worry if the eraser crumbles and the fragments accumulate in the suede.Suede BrushesNever use wired brush. Instead, buy suede brushes designed and made using soft bristles that will not rip the shoe hair. Don't ever try using shoe polishes on suede. A good quality suede polish should be used instead.Suede ProtectorsThese generally come in spray form and protects your shoes from water and any other greasy stains. The formula contains a special polymer which produces an invisible protective shield and thereby ensures that your suede lasts longer.For Mild CleaningCleaning, polishing and conditioning the leather shoe regularly with high quality cleaners, polishes and sprays is recommended. It is recommended to use non-silicone shoe spray to prevent the shoe colour from changing.

Middle-class to boost premium business,There is already a clear shift in demographics with a visible increase in double-income families. ,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)MUMBAI: With India rapidly transitioning from a bottom of the pyramid status to become a truly middle-income country in the next 12 years, marketers are exploring fresh avenues of growth from up-trading consumers. By 2030, India will add approximately 140 million middle-income and almost 30 million high-income households, according to research by Bain & Company.At 61 million, comprising 21% of existing households today, the number of upper middle-income households will more than double to 168 million — or 44% of the total households in the country — in the next 12 years, Bain & Company partner Nikhil Prasad Ojha told TOI. The outcome of this economic transformation, said Ojha, will be most evident in low-income households (see graphic). The 127 million low-income households in 2018 (which form 43% of India’s total households) are expected to reduce to 57 million — just 15% of the total — by 2030. In the same period, lower middle-class income households will see a marginal rise from 97 million (33% of total households) currently to 132 million (34%).  Organisations cutting across consumer-facing industries would gain from more households having better disposable incomes. “This is music to the ears of the consumer durables industry,” said Vijay Sales managing partner Nilesh Gupta. “The increase in the upper middle-class income to 44% of total households means that the average ticket price would go up drastically. As we all know, it is the evolving group of people who embrace premium brands as soon as they can afford it. Hence, we would see the sale of premium brands and premium products going up significantly. Looking at the scenario, I think we could also see an increase in activity levels of super premium brands like Miele, De Longhi and many more such brands,” said Gupta. Products like dishwashers, high-end vacuum cleaners, 100% clothes dryers, hobs and chimneys would find more takers with the economic transformation. Gupta said there is also a possibility of “premium-only” stores coming up in the metros. “As the middle-class income households increase, the low penetration of consumer durables industry would be a thing of the past,” he added.As purchasing power increases, households would aspire to own cars as well. According to Mahindra & Mahindra chief people officer Rajeshwar Tripathi, an enhanced purchasing capacity primarily impacts sale of automobiles in two ways: While customers become choosy, aspiration levels escalate in terms of taste, comfort and features. The auto industry could benefit from a portfolio of cars in the mid to high end of the price pyramid.There is already a clear shift in demographics with a visible increase in double-income families. “Salary levels, be it fresh or lateral hire, have also seen a consistent double-digit growth in the past six-seven years and we see this trend continuing. The other factor that is leading to this transition of being a middle-income country is the demand for emerging skill sets and how it is effectively commanding a higher premium. Consequently, we are witnessing a growth in average salary. All these factors are significantly contributing to higher disposable incomes,” said Tripathi.An economically evolved consumer would only bolster the growth of personal care products. FMCG players are eyeing a share of the rising disposable incomes of households by offering products with exotic ingredients like aloe vera. Fabric softeners, hair serums and premium brands of makeup and skin creams are some of segments that could see a growth boom in the coming years. The transformation is aiding the trend of premiumisation and convenience, said Marico MD & CEO Saugata Gupta. Modern retail and e-commerce, he added, have a big role to play here. The shift in demographics indicates that niche players would operate largely in the top and bottom end of the pyramid, while organised players would target mainly the mid-segment.","Jan 02, 2019, 10:45 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/middle-class-to-boost-premium-business/articleshow/67333008.cms

Five PSBs not meeting capital criterion can trigger contagion sans govt support,The RBI defended its Prompt Corrective Action framework for the state-run banks,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) warned that the absence of perceived sovereign guarantees to banks under the Prompt Corrective Action would amplify the contagion risk of default in the banking industry as five state-owned lenders would fall below the minimum capital requirements.For stress test purposes if it is assumed that state-owned banks don’t have the backing of the government, “then (it) implies that the five PSBs which don’t meet the criterion of Tier-1 capital of 7 per cent would default and start a contagion process on their own,” said RBI’s Financial Stability Report.For the FSR, the RBI conducts various kinds of stress tests – liquidity, credit and macro-economic developments. It mostly assesses the impact on the assumption that the state would back government banks. But for theoretical purposes, it conducted such tests without state backing this time.“So now, when we consider the hypothetical failure of a trigger bank, the losses that would accrue to the system would not only be because of the trigger bank in consideration, but also because of the five PSBs that were automatically triggered,” said the report.The RBI defended its Prompt Corrective Action framework for the state-run banks, a framework that became a major point of contention between the regulator and the government. The RBI said the capital erosion of the 11 banks under the PCA showed that solvency losses have reduced.“Solvency losses due to a simultaneous failure of 11 PCA banks have declined from Rs 73,500 crore to Rs 34,200 crore (3.1 per cent of total Tier-1 Capital) in the past four quarters, and to this extent the PCA framework has been successful in reducing the systemic footprint of the PCA banks,” said the report.Under the PCA, banks that have high bad loans and low capital are barred from setting up new branches, hiring staff and giving big-ticket loans and in some cases, even advance funds to small businesses.

Baby products of Himalaya and Chicco under scanner,"The drug regulator has picked up over 200 samples of various talcum powders, soaps, shampoos and other baby products to check compliance and safety.","NEW DELHI: After Johnson & Johnson, other brands of infant care products including Himalaya and Chicco have come under the regulatory scanner. The drug regulator has picked up over 200 samples of various talcum powders, soaps, shampoos and other baby products to check compliance and safety, official sources said.However, the main focus of the investigation is to ascertain that all talcum powder brands in the market are safe and do not contain asbestos, the official told TOI.The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) – the country’s top drug regulator – has collected around 150 samples of talcum powder and another 50 samples of other infant care products such as baby shampoo, cream, lotion and soap. Apart from the samples of finished products, the regulator has also collected around 14 samples of raw material, mainly talc, used in making these products.All the samples have been sent for testing to one of the central testing laboratory with specialisation in testing cosmetics.“We want to ensure that not only J&J’s but all the baby products available in Indian markets are safe and asbestos free. Therefore, after collecting samples from J&J during site inspections, we decided to test samples of other brands of baby products too,” the official said, adding the test reports for the samples are expected within next 15 days.Earlier in December, the drug regulator conducted raids on factories of J&J in Baddi and Mumbai and collected samples of finished products and raw material after reports in the US alleged that J&J’s powder contains “cancer-causing” asbestos and that the American company may have known this since 1971.Following the inspections, the Indian regulator also issued prohibitory orders to J&J’s two factories asking the company to not use the talc raw material available in the units for any production till further order. It had also expanded the scope of investigation to cover the company’s iconic brands of baby shampoo and soap.In July, a Missouri court had ordered J&J to pay $4.7 billion compensation and damages to 22 women in the US who claimed asbestos in its talc had caused them ovarian cancer.Though J&J maintains its products are “safe and asbestos free”, the allegations triggered a fresh investigation in India with the regulator inspecting facilities as well as collecting samples of not just powder but also various other products from the retail market, distributors and wholesalers to test for asbestos and other compliance as per the Indian standards.At present, the company is facing more than 9,000 cases over body powder containing talc and has consistently denied that its products are dangerous or contain asbestos.","Jan 01, 2019, 11:19 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/baby-products-of-himalaya-and-chicco-under-scanner/articleshow/67333120.cms
Wanna play on oil price fall? Look at this Indian firm with global play,FIBC as a packaging medium is widely used in developed countries like the US and Europe.,"By Ekansh Mittal The rupee is trading around the 70 mark to the dollar and crude oil has crashed from its recent high of $80 per barrel to below $55 a barrel. I personally believe the rupee may continue to trade above 70 and it seems unlikely that oil will again rise very sharply.Over the next few years companies that might do well will be the ones that are majorly into exports and are dependent on crude or its derivative as raw material source.Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Oil India Ltd  moved down by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »In line with the above strategy, I would like to bring to your notice a smallcap company, called Kanpur Plastipack (KPL). It is engaged in manufacturing of flexible intermediate bulk containers (FIBCs), HDPE/PP woven sacks, PP box bags, fabrics and high tenacity PP. FIBCs are industrial bulk packaging products finding applications in the packaging of food stuffs, chemicals, minerals and agricultural products.FIBC as a packaging medium is widely used in developed countries like the US and Europe. Exports account for around 75-80 per cent of the company’s sales and key raw materials used by the company are PP and LDPE granules, whose prices are dependent on crude oil prices.The company is in the process of expanding its manufacturing capacities and has raised capital through a rights issue last year.As on date, we like several points about this company:FIBC industry growing well: - India is now gaining the centrestage in the global packaging industry and has about 42 per cent of the global market share of FIBCs. There are only 25-30 players in the Indian FIBC industry and only 10 have large capacities. Globally, there’s competition from China, Turkey and some South American nations. However, increasingly they seem to be losing market shares (Turkey is losing market share because of political reasons) to their Indian counterparts. That should help an industrywide growth of 10-15 per cent in India.Capacity expansion on the verge of completion: – The company has been facing capacity constraints since last three years and to overcome the same, a major project is under way. It will help substantial expansion of the existing capacities and consolidation of operations. The greenfield expansion will result in 60% increase in FIBC capacity and 100% increase in the capacity of multi-filament yarn (MFY).The company has already commercialised some of the capacities. However, the entire project (including shifting from existing locations) is expected to go on-stream in FY 20. On the back of the greenfield expansions and consolidation of existing operations at the new site, the company is hopeful of recording a turnover of Rs 450 crore in next two years against Rs 280 crore recorded in FY18.Capacity expansions without much strain on balance sheet: – In last two-and-a-half years, the company has expanded its net block by more than 100 per cent. The company has spent around Rs 80 crore on capacity expansions. However, the absolute debt has increased by only Rs 50 crore, while the debt-equity ratio has deteriorated marginally from 0.98 to 1.10 (as of Sept’18)Reasonable valuation:– Last but not the least, the stock is currently trading around 9 times trailing 12-months earnings while during the last 3-4 years it traded in the range of 5-20 times earnings. Taking into account the capacity expansion and expected improvement in earnings, we believe the downside is limited while the upside could be much more over the next 2-3 years.(Ekansh Mittal is founder of Kanpur-based Katalyst Wealth.

"Delhi: War memorial ready, 60 years after it was first proposed","The National War Memorial (NWM) is now finally ready, around 60 years after it was first proposed by the armed forces and remained stuck in general politico-bureaucratic apathy, to honour the over 22,600 soldiers who have laid down their lives in wars and operations since Independence.","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: “When you go home, tell them of us, and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today”. This evocative eulogy to soldiers who make the supreme sacrifice to defend their country is all set to resonate in the New Year.The National War Memorial (NWM) is now finally ready, around 60 years after it was first proposed by the armed forces and remained stuck in general politico-bureaucratic apathy, to honour the over 22,600 soldiers who have laid down their lives in wars and operations since Independence. Defence officials say Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the “world-class” NWM, adjoining the India Gate complex on the majestic Rajpath in the capital, on January 25. “India was probably the only major country not to have a NWM,” said a senior officer.  “The life of an Indian soldier, after all, comes dirt cheap. The NWM will finally fulfil this long-pending emotional demand of the armed forces, which over the years successfully resisted moves to shift it elsewhere or to the outskirts of Delhi,” he added.India Gate itself was constructed by the British in memory of the 84,000 Indian soldiers killed fighting for the Empire in World War-I and the Afghan campaign, with the Amar Jawan Jyoti later being built under its arch to honour the 3,843 soldiers who died liberating Bangladesh in 1971.The NWM, built at a cost of Rs 176 crore after being approved by the government in October 2015, was initially slated for inauguration on August 15 in 2018, but missed its deadline for completion. Built in keeping with the “aesthetics and sanctity” of the Central Vista and India Gate, it has a layout of four landscaped concentric circles spread over 40 acres.The Amar Chakra (circle of immortality), Veer Chakra (circle of bravery), Tyag Chakra (circle of sacrifice) and Rakshak Chakra (circle of protection) will include a 15-metre tall central obelisk with the eternal flame, bronze murals, graphic panels, inscription of names of martyrs and busts of the 21 Param Vir Chakra awardees, as earlier reported by TOI. “The NWM, with a central congregation space, has been designed to ensure it does not obstruct the existing layout of Rajpath and its iconic structures,” said the official.A suitable design, in turn, is in the process of being identified for the proposed National War Museum at Princess Park, adjoining the NWM at the C Hexagon of the India Gate complex. “The museum will take some years to be constructed. The initial cost approved for it is around Rs 350 crore,” he added.","Jan 01, 2019, 12:21 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/delhi-war-memorial-ready-60-years-after-it-was-first-proposed/articleshow/67333143.cms
RBI vs Govt in 2018: A 'husband-wife' relation that turned stormy,"The genesis of differences between RBI and govt was one-day default norms announced on February 12, 2018.","The relation between the Reserve Bank and the government is akin to that of 'husband and wife', former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once famously said but that bond turned sour in 2018, leading to unprecedented episodes that culminated in the abrupt resignation of Urjit Patel as the governor.Differences between the Centre and the RBI over easing of lending restrictions for certain sectors and the appropriate size of reserves to be maintained by the central bank, among other issues, spilled out. It was further aggravated when deputy governor Viral Acharya spoke of maintaining autonomy and independence of the central bank.It soon unravelled that the government had cited a never-used-before provision of the RBI Act to get the central bank to discuss issues it considered of public importance.This seemed to have been the culmination of a series of events that began with the government getting persons considered close to its ideology being appointed as directors on the RBI's central board. Swadeshi ideologue S Gurumurthy vigorously pushed the government's cause especially with regard to taking a more liberal view on issues such as reserves the central bank must maintain.Soon enough there was speculation that the then Governor Patel would resign but he chose to stay on to see if there was a resolution and quit when there wasn't a common ground found even over names of an expert committee the RBI and government had agreed to constitute to look into appropriate size of reserves the central bank must maintain.The government quickly moved in and appointed a former bureaucrat who from day one showed a willingness to consider all issues on the table and take a more consultative approach rather than being a confrontationalist.Winds of changes are already visible at Mint Street as Shaktikanta Das has held at least three consultations with bankers over different issues, a trend which was a rarity during Patel's tenure.Many blamed the pressure brought by the government on the central bank to ease lending restrictions and release more of its capital to bolster the economy for Patel's resignation. Patel became the first since post economic liberalisation in 1991 to resign as the RBI governor.In independent India, the first governor to resign was Benegal Rama Rau in 1955 during the tenure of the Jawaharlal Nehru government. Indira Gandhi got S Jagannathan to resign after he refused to give an enhanced loan to Maruti in 1975. During Chandra Shekhar government (1990), R N Malhotra had to resign due to differences with the government.Patel was hand-picked by the BJP-led government after his predecessor Raghuram Rajan was denied a second-term.A Kenyan national who acquired Indian citizenship prior to being appointed as Deputy Governor of the RBI in January 2013, Oxford-trained Patel was initially seen as toeing government line after he backed the November 2016 shock decision to overnight junk 86 per cent of the currency in circulation.Since then, he was seen waging a war to get the struggling banking system in order and punish defaulting borrowers.The genesis of differences between the RBI and the government was one-day default norms announced by the central bank on February 12, 2018.The RBI aligned the revised norms with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as it also recognised the one-day default norms.According to the RBI, the revised framework tried to reduce the arbitrage the borrowers are currently enjoying while raising funds through borrowing from banks vis-a-vis from the capital markets.Besides, there were some disagreements on weak bank norms, Prompt Corrective Action (PCA). Of 21 public sector banks, 11 are under PCA framework due to declining profit and rising bad loans.The PCA framework kicks in when banks breach any of the three key regulatory trigger points -- namely capital to risk weighted assets ratio, net non-performing assets (NPA) and return on assets (RoA).The government wanted the RBI to align its PCA framework with global norms, which recognises only slippage on capital to risk weighted assets ratio.The differences came out in the open when Deputy Governor Acharya, in a hard-hitting speech in October, talked about the independence of the central bank, arguing that any compromise could be ""potentially catastrophic"" for the economy.Subsequently, Economic Affairs Seceretary Subhash Chandra Garg and government nominee on the Board took an apparent dig at Acharya's 'wrath of financial markets' comment in a tweet saying vital indicators of the economy were showing improvement.""The autonomy for the central bank, within the framework of the RBI Act, is an essential and accepted governance requirement. Government of India has nurtured and respected this,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.However, there was truce on two issues, including with regard to reserves. It was agreed that an expert panel to examine the Economic Capital Framework (ECF) of RBI in its central board meeting on November 19.The RBI, while deciding to retain the CRAR at 9 per cent, agreed to extend the transition period for implementing the last tranche of 0.625 per cent under the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), by one year, up to March 31, 2020.Despite reaching some common ground on contentious issues, Patel in a surprise move resigned on December 10 leaving government perplexed.Acting swiftly, the government very next day, appointed former Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das as the 25th Governor of the RBI.This time government preferred a bureaucrat over an economist after tryst with two economists as head of the central bank.Considered an efficient implementer and a team player, Das may be the right man in the RBI amid tensions with the finance ministry over governance and autonomy issues.Das, a 1980 batch IAS officer of the Tamil Nadu cadre has worked in economic and finance departments in the state and the centre during his 37-year-long tenure like other previous governors Y V Reddy and D Subbarao who also moved from North Block to the Mint Street.","Jan 01, 2019, 01:15 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-vs-govt-in-2018-a-husband-wife-relation-that-turned-stormy/articleshow/67333041.cms

The key to overcoming these challenges lies in reforms.,"By Raghuram Rajan and Abhijit BanerjeeLast October thirteen of us, all economists, got together in the hope that as the country gears up for elections, we could start a conversation by identifying a set of policy ideas that might help inform party manifestoes and policy visions. While our views stretch across the spectrum from right to left, we found surprising agreement on the challenges India faces and reforms it needs now. Two of us sifted through the set of ideas, picking what we felt were the top challenges and proposals to address them.As we see it, rethinking government is key. Government capacity is limited. We need to target it better while trying to enhance it. Stability in government policy is important so that our farmers and firms can plan better, and markets can play a more effective role. Cooperative federalism, Centre and states working together and learning from each other, is essential.1. The massive aggregate fiscal deficit of the states and Centre combined leaves fewer, costlier, resources for private investment. We should aim to hit the FRBM-suggested 5% by 2023, but not by creative accounting or off-balance sheet transactions. Instead, we must increase revenues, both through better compliance and more progressive taxation, and target spending better. State deficits have grown, partly because markets assume that the Centre will bail out over-extended states and therefore do not charge them higher interest rates. To incentivise better behaviour, any state’s borrowing above agreed limits should be funded through special bonds that are explicitly free of any federal guarantee. A Centre-state council modelled on the successful GST council could supervise fiscal federalism.2. Three sectors that are distressed today are agriculture, power, and banking, despite massive past government intervention, and often because of it. For example, periodic export bans and large-scale imports to keep food inflation down have radically moved the terms of trade against agriculture, while reducing the farmer’s ability to plan. Cheap or free power to farmers have depleted the water table to the point of disaster. Farmers do need assistance. However, the instruments used – loan waivers, inflated MSPs without adequate procurement, and input price subsidies – often exacerbate the problem. In addition to enhancing investment in new technologies and irrigation, a government move towards lump sum payments to farmers for holding below a certain limit, in the spirit of Telangana’s Rythu Bandhu scheme, will be an improvement.Similarly, distressed state-owned power distribution companies stand between power producers who want to sell more and consumers who want more reliable power. The solutions are well-known – better metering, less distorted pricing of both power as well as energy inputs, and the use of new, cleaner technologies for distributed production and decentralising distribution. All these require rethinking the government’s role, as will any sustainable solution to banking sector distress.3. We need a better business environment – whether to create the jobs for those leaving agriculture, urban schools, or our universities, or to ramp up our woefully inadequate exports. We need to learn from state experiences about what works in areas like land acquisition, industrial regulation, provision of power and logistics, and environmental clearances. A Centre-State Productivity Council can be useful for this; such a Council could revive the idea of Special Economic Zones where coordinated land, environmental clearances and transportation infrastructure are available on a “plug-in” basis. Such zones, not necessarily targeted at exports, may also be used to experiment with reforms such as changes in labour laws before an all-India roll-out, to provide the evidence needed to build consensus for them.4. Sustainable growth requires more effective but less burdensome regulation. Our cities are choking and climate change is upon us. Municipalities need the powers and funding to deal with these challenges, which means more decentralisation. In other areas, we need more centralisation: for instance, a new and technically beefed up environmental regulator, combining powers that are currently with multiple bodies, setting fees based on careful analysis of tradeoffs, and enforcing them.5. Government has to provide for benefits, but is not always best suited to deliver them. To reduce the implementation burden and free up its ability to take on new challenges, government should move towards cash transfers. As a first step, beneficiaries of all specific government subsidy programmes should have the choice between cash transfers and benefits in kind.Many of our challenges also have to do with enhancing the capabilities of our people.6. We need more skilled personnel in government – at higher levels in technical areas like digitisation, trade negotiation, and environmental regulation but also at lower levels outside the larger cities. More lateral entrants, merging into the permanent civil service, are desirable near the top. At lower levels, too many youth waste years taking competitive exams for government jobs that most will never get. One alternative that will give them skills and work experience is a multi-year paid government internship at salaries comparable to entry level market wages (much less than what the government pays) for those under 26 to work as support staff in government offices/ public sector enterprises where needed. Performance on these could help entry into permanent government jobs, though political pressure to make these internships permanent should be resisted.7. The Right to Education Act focusses on input requirements for schools that have little bearing on learning outcomes, which have deteriorated alarmingly. Learning must be our central focus, with all schools, public and private, responsible for delivering a minimum level of basic skills to every child. Bringing those falling behind up to par through remedial teaching will be critical.8. We must address the coming explosion of Non-Communicable Diseases, which will require engagement with the frontline providers. The vast majority of these have no formal qualifications, but the evidence suggests they can be trained and pushed towards practising better medicine. Since they have the patients’ ears, the health system should use them better rather than ignoring them.Raghuram Rajan is Professor of Finance at University of Chicago. Abhijit Banerjee is Professor of Economics at MIT. Here is a fuller list of proposals.

New Year special: Should you switch to passive mutual funds in 2019?,Only four per cent actively-managed mutual fund schemes managed to generate positive alpha for the investors in the last year.,"Actively-managed equity mutual fund schemes had a tough year in 2018. Only four per cent actively-managed mutual fund schemes managed to generate positive alpha for the investors in the last year. Passively-managed schemes like index schemes and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) clearly edged out their actively-managed peers in 2018. For example, top 14 schemes in around 100 largecap funds are all index funds or ETFs. These data points compelled us to look at the long track record of both active and passive funds to help our readers make an informed investment choice to reach goals with ease.We at ETMutualFunds.com. decided to take out rolling returns of actively-managed funds and passive funds, including index funds and ETFs. Since the aim of this exercise is to make a choice between active vs passive, we restricted our study to two mutual fund categories- largecap and midcaps.We calculated five- and seven-year rolling returns, rolled on a daily basis over a period of 20 years starting December 1998. Well, this data is based on past performance. Going back to basics, higher the sample size higher is the reliability of study’s outcome. That is why we have chosen a long period of 20 years for our study.By now, our regular readers must be aware of rolling returns, but for the first timers, it is like a daily SIP for a certain interval and then taking an average of the series of returns. For more on rolling returns, read this: What is a rolling return? Result of our study: In the midcap category, the clear winners were the actively-managed funds. However, the alpha generation was restrained in the largecap category. Here are the details: In the midcap category, while Nifty ETFs gave CAGR 14.49 per cent and 12.97 per cent and midcap index funds gave 12.79 per cent, 11.72 per cent respectively in five- and seven-year period, actively managed funds on an average gave 17.50 per cent and 16.77 per cent in the same time period.Sensex ETFs on an average generated CAGR rolling returns of 13.39 per cent and 12.21 per cent in five- and seven-year period. Similarly, largecap index funds gave 11.67 per cent and 10.90 per cent. On the other hand, actively-managed largecap funds gave 14.53 per cent CAGR rolling returns (5-year period) and 13.55 per cent (7-year period).See table below for details:5-yr rolling returns (%)7-yr rolling returns (%) AverageMinMaxAverageMinMaxLargecapETFs13.39-0.244.6512.21530.01Index funds11.67-2.9343.8410.92.9628.06Active funds14.53-13.0763.0413.55-5.4743.18MidcapETFs14.49-0.2746.3512.974.6829.83Index funds12.78-2.8145.9511.722.6929.75Active funds17.5-16.9474.816.77-13.8653.48Source: Ace MFTo conclude, alpha generation in largecap schemes has shrunk.

Years roll by but Bengaluru's wish-list remains the same, It is not that nothing has changed for the better in these years. It is just that more needs to be done and quickly.,"If one were to make a wish-list for Bengaluru at the beginning of the New Year, it could well resemble the wish-lists of 2018, 2017 and earlier. Well, almost. Saving lakes, speeding up the metro, easing traffic, better solid waste management, people’s participation in planning, sustainable solutions... we had them all written down long ago, no doubt. It is not that nothing has changed for the better in these years. It is just that more needs to be done and quickly. ET lists out what needs to be done to revive Bengaluru.CITIZENS NEED A SAYA majority of infrastructure projects, big and small, are pitched, passed and executed by the government without a semblance of public consultation. In the recent years, the government has had a taste of the backlash this could lead to. People’s ire against the 6.7-km steel flyover from Basaveshwara Circle to Hebbal in 2016 was the beginning. Unfortunately, the state government appears not to have learnt lessons from it, if its urgency to execute the elevated corridor project is any indication. Citizens won a minor victory in 2018 when the BBMP commissioner ordered that ward committee meetings be held every month. This is the first step for public involvement in planning at the ward level. The hope for 2019 is to build on this.“We hope that, for all large city-wide projects, public consultation is held before it gets budget allocation,” said Srinivas Alavilli, cofounder, Citizens for Bengaluru.RESTORE DYING LAKESTowards the end of 2018, there was some relief when the National Green Tribunal directed the state government to deposit Rs 500 crore in an escrow account for the rejuvenation of the highly-polluted Bellandur lake. The NGT also formed a committee chaired by former Lokayukta N Santosh Hegde to monitor the process. While this could be a new beginning for Bellandur lake, hundreds of other lakes in the capital await rejuvenation. A survey of 105 lakes, done by the Indian Institute of Science in 2016, revealed that only four were in good condition.Environmentalists hope that the authorities first clear encroachments and restore lakes on a priority in 2019. “First, measures should be taken to stop sewage entering lakes and ensure that only clean water flows in. Then, all lakes should be desilted so that their waterholding capacity increases. Pollutants inside the lake should be removed and disposed of scientifically,” said V Ramprasad from Friends of Lakes.REVISING THE MASTER PLANThe Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) started work on a Revised Master Plan – 2031 a couple of years ago. After much dilly-dallying, it made public a provisional RMP during the end of 2017 and called for objections and suggestions. The draft RMP drew citizens’ wrath for being vague and replete with technical errors. Citizens even approached the judiciary questioning the power of BDA to plan the city.Although Bengaluru development minister Dr G Parameshwara has said that the government will revisit the draft RMP, citizens want the Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC) to draft the RMP and not the BDA. “The BDA should acknowledge that it is at best a construction company and not capable of preparing a master plan. The government should follow the constitutional process and hand over the responsibility to MPC,” said Vijayan Menon from Citizens’ Action Forum that has filed a PIL in the HC.WASTE AS RESOURCEUnable to manage its waste effectively, Bengaluru, which generates around 6,000 tonne of waste per day, sends most of its unsegregated waste to the Bellahalli quarry on the city outskirts. Plans to process segregated waste and prepare compost has not been quite successful. After a gap of two years, the government appointed a special commissioner for solid waste management in the BBMP last year. After taking charge, D Randeep has come up with several plans, one of which is to call for ward-wise tenders to collect and transport dry waste and wet waste separately.“If only the BBMP would make a clean sweep of the pile-up at least in 2019, including issuing the new door-to-door collection contracts, resolving pending issues on biogas facilities which have been idle since 2016, clearing all pending proposals of 2017 for mechanised sweepers, procurement of vehicles and transfer stations,” said Sandhya Narain from the Solid Waste Management Round Table.CLEANER AIRThough the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board’s (KSPCB) data on ambient air quality shows a decrease in air pollution levels during the past two years, people who are exposed to traffic and pollution disagree. An increase in traffic, depleting green cover, road dust, burning of garbage are adding to the pollution. In order to get data that is closer to reality, experts and independent observers of atmospheric pollution demand that the KSPCB install more pollution monitoring stations at the breathing level. After all, getting real data is key to addressing the issue. For now, the KSPCB has 21 monitoring stations.“The state government has to take policy decisions, such as prohibiting burning of garbage, implementing mechanised street cleaning, strict control on construction sites and cement mixing plants. For all this to happen, we need the KSPCB to fulfil its role with full accountability and transparency,” said Zibi Jamal from Whitefield Rising.THE TRAFFIC QUAGMIREThe government wants to have an automobile-friendly infrastructure — a 102-km elevated corridor, many small flyovers and widening of roads — and hopes that it will improve the traffic flow. Those who know better are opposing these and advocating sustainable mobility solutions. Big infra projects in brick and mortar will only help the automobile industry and do not solve traffic issues, they believe. Urban transport expert Pawan Mulukutla argues that the solution lies in a multi-pronged approach. He suggests three solutions that can be implemented in less than a year: Smaller interventions such as installing adaptive signals that turn either red or green based on the volume of traffic on different sides of the junction. Along with coordinated traffic signals, this can reduce congestion at least by 10%, he said. Second, a pay-and-park system at least on roads that have good public transport systems. Last but most importantly, infrastructure to encourage footpath and cycling would discourage use of vehicles for short-distance commutes, he holds.HURRY UP, NAMMA METROThe existing 42-km Namma Metro network — which took almost a decade to build — caters to about 4-lakh people a day. Currently, civil work is underway on the 72-km Phase II network. Of them, the metro lines on Mysuru Road (9 km) and Kanakapura Road (7 km) are nearing completion and likely to be operational in early 2020. The transport utility proposed a metro line on the 19-km Outer Ring Road (Central Silk Board - KR Puram) but tenders for this line were cancelled, setting the project back by one year. It also turns out that alignment for the 30-km line to the Kempegowda International Airport is not finalised.Urban mobility activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said the BMRCL should acquire land before awarding construction contracts. The other hope is that all the 50 shuttles of the metro will double their capacity (from 3-coach trains to 6-coach trains) in 2019. It is also high time that the city’s public transport gets a common mobility card. SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONSThe government announced three bigticket projects in 2018 — the suburban rail system, the 102-km elevated corridor and the 65-km peripheral ring road. The much-awaited suburban rail system is likely to take off in 2019. The PRR project could finally see some groundwork.Urbanist V Ravichandar wants the government to focus on the basics instead of announcing mega projects. “Building a good footpath on 2,000-km road would give out a different message but the government is not encouraging it at all,” he said. The government, he said, should make buses more popular. “Use of technology and rationalisation of routes are the easiest steps but that have been ignored. Even the strength of the bus fleet is stagnant for the past oneMITIGATING WATER CRISISIn 2018, environment magazine ‘Down To Earth’ claimed that the IT city is among the 10 cities in the world on the verge of an acute water crisis. The Karnataka government, however, has dismissed the report saying Bengaluru will not run out of water as it is building infrastructure to fetch an additional 775 MLD of water from the Cauvery river. The government is also making efforts to cut down unaccounted-for water and is building infrastructure to provide water supply for 110 additional villages.Water expert, Vishwanath Srikantaiah, said the solution lies in strengthening the institution (BWSSB), especially by deploying human resource and capital investments. “Some of the infrastructure (underground drainage and water pipelines) are ageing but the BWSSB has no money to fix the problem,” he said. He felt the ideal way to raise funds is to stop providing subsidised water to the rich. “The BWSSB spends Rs 65 to supply one kilo litre of water but the consumers are only paying Rs 8 per kilolitre,” he pointed out.","Jan 01, 2019, 11:38 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/years-roll-by-but-bengalurus-wish-list-remains-the-same/articleshow/67333218.cms

"PSU share sale hits record high of Rs 77,417 crore in 2018",,"The government raised a record Rs 77,417 crore from sale of its stake in public sector units in 2018, and the disinvestment programme is headed for another blockbuster year in 2019 with planned privatisation of national carrier Air India. The BJP-led NDA, which in its previous stint privatised the most number of PSUs ever, continues to shy away from the outright sale of bluechip state firms to the private sector in the present regime and is instead pursuing a newfound strategy of merging companies to meet its revenue targets. While big-ticket disinvestments, including ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, CPSE ETF, Bharat-22 ETF, and Coal India stake sale, along with 6 initial public offerings (IPO) brought Rs 77,417 crore to the government coffers last year, while the year was marred by botched attempt of the government to sell 74 per cent stake in Air India.

As part of the plan, it will sell subsidiaries, like Air India Air Transport Service Ltd (AIATSL), Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL), and land and building assets of Air India separately to help trim Rs 29,000 crore debt burden of the national carrier. Alongside, the government will continue to infuse funds into the airline to keep it viable, and finally sell it after extensive deliberations with potential investors to ensure that the airline gets the best valuation. The subsidiaries and assets alone are expected to fetch the government close to Rs 9,000 crore. The first off the blocks in strategic sale plan for 2019 will be Pawan Hans where the government holds 51 per cent, while oil major ONGC holds the remaining stake. The sale of helicopter service provider Pawan Hans is expected to be completed by March. Besides, buyback programme of as many as 10 CPSEs, including ONGC, Indian Oil Corp, Oil India, NLC, BHEL and NALCO, are on course, which could fetch about Rs 12,000 crore to the exchequer. CPSE (Central Public Sector Enterprise) merger and acquisitions will be one of the focus areas of the government this year as it waits to see PFC's (Power Finance Corporation) plan to buy out government stake in Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) for an estimated Rs 15,000 crore fructify. The next such M&A deal will be NTPC, buying government stake in SJVN for about Rs 6,000 crore. These M&As are being planned in the lines of ONGC-HPCL deal, which happened in January last year. ONGC bought government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in oil refiner HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. Budget targets for disinvestment proceeds are fixed for the financial year beginning April and ending in March. The ONGC-HPCL deal helped the government cross the magical Rs 1 lakh crore mark in disinvestment mop-up in 2017-18 fiscal, up from Rs 72,500 crore target. For the ongoing 2018-19 fiscal, which ends in March 2019, the target has been set at Rs 80,000 crore. The year 2018 saw IPO of two CPSEs from railway sector -- RITES and IRCON. Four more CPSEs -- Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Dynamics, Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers -- also made their debut on the stock exchanges last year. With markets remaining volatile for the most part on account of geopolitical tensions and trade war concerns, the offer for sale (OFS) route for CPSE disinvestment was not tapped much in the last year. The government raised Rs 5,218 crore from Coal India share sale in November and Rs 1,200 crore from NMDC stake sale in January. Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) emerged as the most viable route for CPSE share sale with CPSE ETF garnering Rs 17,000 crore and Bharat-22 ETF Rs 8,325 crore. This year will see more of ETF offering, even as the government goes on to test waters with the launch of a debt ETF to help CPSEs and public sector banks to raise capital to meet their capital expenditure needs.

"Look at 2019 as the SIP or STP year: S Naren, ICICI Pru AMC",,"2019 is going to be a volatile year. That is the reason we have been recommending, calling it the SIP year, S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: Will 2019 be a good year for investors or would it be a year where markets will get earnings projections wrong, politics will have a larger role and the market mood will very choppy and unpredictable? When you compare 2018 January with 2019 January, our view is that 2019 January shows a greater safety margin than in the same period 2018. In 2018 January, most of the market looked fully valued and most of the smallcaps and midcaps looked over-valued. Starting 2019, you find that 80% of the stocks are fairly valued and a small set of stocks could be considered overvalued. So from a mutual fund point of view, which is long-term investor point of view, 2019 January is much better time than 2018 January.  Having said that, basically what happens is an election year coupled with US Fed’s last few tightening makes for a volatile year and therefore again from the point view of mutual fund, it becomes very easy to look at 2019 as a SIP or STP year. It is very different from 2018. In 2018, we believed that as you went down the market cap curve, there were more risks and now actually there are much more stock picking potentials and you have a much better environment for stock pickers now although it was believed last year was the best year for stock picking. But frankly, except the four or five mega caps, everything else actually went down through the year.  Shorter duration corporate debt has emerged as an interesting asset class: S Naren, ICICI Prudential AMCIndia will always remain outperforming market because one dollar drop in oil improves India’s current account deficit by $1.5 billion or so,  S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC, tells ET Now.  So 2019 is a more interesting year for all of us. It is equally likely to be volatile but I would call it a year to put money and accumulate money in equities at this point time. So that is why I like 2019 over 2018 clearly as we speak. All through 2018, the call was stick with largecaps or at best diversify into multicaps. Is the risk reward ratio in favour of midcaps a little bit more now?  I believe you are safer in stock picking now rather than going by capitalisation weightage because if you look at largecaps, there are clearly 10 stocks which look overvalued at this point of time. On the other hand similarly in mid and smallcaps also, there are stocks which look overvalued.  Having said that, today there are a number of smallcaps that have corrected 30-40%, midcaps that have corrected 20% or so. I would say 2019 is stock picking time rather than deciding which caps to go and where we have changed. Look at where we were and consider the calls that we got wrong. We did not recognise that oil could come down from $85 to $53 and that actually completely changed the outlook towards sectors like infrastructure or banking which clearly benefit with lower interest rates. Banks get some treasury profits as well. Sectors like banking and infrastructure have seen reasonably positive change through the year particularly with the fall in oil. Do you think that 2019 would spell great news for the financial sector and is there an opportunity to generate alpha for the beaten down names? Clearly, banks are in the best situation they have been in the last five-six years. Their cost of borrowing is not going up. Their lending rates are going up. The NPL cycle in corporate India is about to get over and lot of provisioning has been built for that NPL cycle. So, banks are in extremely good phase compared after 2015. From a fundamental point of view, we are in the best phase for banks and that need not be true for all other parts of the financial services industry but banks are the biggest. They have contributed to lower earnings growth in the last six to seven years and they are going to give a cyclical benefit over the next two years in earnings which should help overall earnings of largecaps pretty significantly in the next two years. I would be much more positive on corporate focussed banks rather than the retail banks because the retail banks have had a good run over the last six to seven years. How long can we ignore the selling in US markets? Is it the biggest risk for 2019 that the correction in US market has started largely due to economic reasons and if the correction multiples, we could be looking at serious downside somewhere in 2019? People make use of valuations as a way of saying that the US market is extremely overvalued. When I look at valuations of let us say some of the consumer names, they do not look very high. Clearly, the US market required a correction but I am not so worried about US markets. The US economy is possibly one of the best economies at this point of time and I do not see the risk of a big fall in US. The conditions that existed in 2007 in the form of extra leverage with people and various other problems in the financial system, I do not see that kind of a situation at this point of time.  I got a chance to meet with some good global economists and they say barring corporates to some extent, I do not think there is any evidence of extremely high leverage. I am basically not worried about big fall in the markets. But that does not mean that markets are headed one way upward because there is no fear still in India or many of the markets.  Second, look at the EMs. There was a cycle from 2009 to 2018, which I would call the US cycle and I would even call it the US tech cycle because you can look at companies like GE over the last 10 years and say that nothing has happened in US. In 10 years, GE has gone down so significantly and I would say that it is the US tech cycle which looks more advanced.  Emerging markets have not had a bull run for a long period of time. I am sure that in the last 10 years, particularly on a dollar basis, emerging markets have shown a significant underperformance. I am not in that extremely worried camp. The challenge at this point of time is how much positive returns can you make rather than expecting negative returns or minus 20 or something like that. In a country like India, corporate papers give you 8-9-10% on a three-year basis and so the benchmark return that you have to get on corporate papers for equity to deliver is a challenge we are facing. This is one of the reasons what we have been always doing is marketing debt funds through the year and contrary to what people think, 2018 was a year that most debt funds did well and even today, corporate papers are giving you good interest rates. So I would say the challenge is how much does equity outperformed debt and that is the challenge rather than worrying too much about equities per se.  Considering that bond yields are sub-7.5%, what kind of return can we expect from debt funds? Corporate spreads in the post September period have gone up substantially. For example, you have a situation where 10-year G-Sec yields have gone down and many of the corporate papers on the three-year side has actually been giving good spreads. People are looking at 10-year yields and saying interest rates are down. I can assure you most of the corporates are actually borrowing at higher rates except may be a few AAA names. Most of them are borrowing at higher rates than what they were borrowing six months back and that is why I would say debt is remaining an interesting asset class at this point of time particularly shorter duration debt on the corporate side is turning out to be a reasonable interesting asset class. How much global pressures can the Indian market withstand in 2019? 2019 is going to be a volatile year. That is the reason we have been recommending, calling it the SIP year. I do not think volatility is going to be any lower in 2019 relative to 2018. But the way, we always look at whether oil is going down along with the markets or if it is going up when the markets are going down. India is very vulnerable even today to oil going up and markets going down together like it happened in October-December when markets and oil fell together. I think India will always remain outperforming market because one dollar drop in oil improves India’s current account deficit by $1.5 billion or so. It becomes a powerful positive for India. I would say that more than global markets, I will watch oil and I would be worried if oil started to go back to $75-80. If there is global volatility, do I worry so much? No I do not worry about it. Having said that, do we expect 2019 to be volatile? The answer is yes. Do we have appropriate strategies within our mutual fund to help make money in volatility, the answer is yes both through products like SIP, STP and balanced advantage as a category, equity savings as a category, etc. I would say that we are not really worried about global volatility. Clearly elections are important. US is important and as I keep telling people there is no point in asking fund managers on elections, they know nothing. That is the way I look at it and but I would say 2019 is a much more interesting year to invest in rather than 2018 and that is the challenge I have in explaining because in 2018 while everything was looking better, the valuations of many of the small and midcaps were also much-much higher than where they are today. Every year we start with the assumption that cyclicals will make a comeback, but by the end of the year we find, it is consumer where the buying power is. We saw that in 2016-17 and 2018. Would 2019 be any different? It better be because for three years we have lost in consumer stocks on a relative basis because along with earnings going up, price to earnings have also been going up. The price to earnings of most consumer names today are much higher than what they were three years back. We are all trained to think that when you do not have a big capex in a sector, finally at the end of that period, earnings will catch up.  If you look at metal stocks, from the bottoms of 2015 they have had a meaningful rally, although 2018 was not a good year. But the 2105-2018 period has been pretty good for metal stocks and I see something similar happening on the cyclical side because if in 10 years, virtually no one has started putting up a power plant, eventually demand for power will catch up and that is why I am really not worried about a cyclical recovery. As long as I am a mutual fund investor, I want to invest for the long term, the longer it takes time for something to play out, the more opportunity I have to get new investors in. So, that is a positive I get from this whole process and that is why for me it is reasonable. If I am a trader and I have kept trading these cyclicals, it could have been a problem but I do not see any big worry on the long term at this point of time.  However, consumer names have baffled us. We have gone wrong frankly and I would say we always look for other cheaper alternatives and barring 2008 and earlier years, we did manage to find stocks which outperformed them. But 2018 was a year where it did not work. And having said that, I believe 2019 is a year where again our stock picking models would certainly work. Let us talk about your NFO. It is an NFO which comes under the category of special situation, in an open ended scheme where you are trying to raise money and when your stocks will be declared on a monthly basis. Will this kind of an approach work and what is the differentiated proposition for this NFO?If you look at the global mutual fund industry, many of them have very large special situation funds and there are fund managers like Anthony Bolton who have actually built their entire fame on the basis of special situations. I believe that Indian markets have moved to a model where special situation investing is likely to work. It requires a large active fund management industry because it is a large active fund management industry which is likely to provide stocks to the special situation fund when a problem happens.  If there is a problem in quality of any product due to which all the active funds start selling, that share it is actually the buyer of that share who will be able to get it cheap. Special situation investing have good scope in the long run clearly because it is one of the techniques to buy cheap and if you manage to buy cheap you have got one part of the investment argument correct. You have quality control, strikes, trade wars, government policy and other kinds of sanctions. I believe that continuously we are going to be in this phase. We are through with the quantitative easing part of the monetary policy in many parts of the world. I think we are in a phase where we should be able to identify special situations and that special situation investing allows to buy cheap and I felt if there is such a big global category which has done well in many parts of the world, I do not see why it should not do well in India and that is how we looked at it. I think that we would be able to buy cheap, it is part of our natural style of investing which is to look for problems and I believe here you can create a portfolio which is only based on buying into special situations. And the important thing which people have to recognise is it is not necessary that you have to buy the sector in trouble, you could buy an unintended beneficiary. So if you look when the bank NPL cycle happened many years ago the biggest gainers were actually NBFCs and the retail banks. So out of that special situation it was not the one with the trouble you buy, you sometimes buy unintended beneficiaries and there also it gives you a lot of investment opportunity. I think what is the challenge here, the challenge is investors have to have a three to five-year outlook, if people have three-month outlook and look at this kind of a strategy I do not think it is likely to work but a three to five-year kind of a strategy is certainly one of the strategies which can deliver longer-term good returns. Special situations are periodic stresses in say telecom or the selloff in NBFCs or the over-valuation in some of the consumer names. Do you think a special situation fund is not like an SIP product? It is something where you need to invest in bulk because a disciplined approach may not work here?  If you look at the last 10 years, there has been wide divergences between the way some sectors like consumer or some of the retail banks have done and how the rest of the market has performed. Special situation investing requires wider divergence of valuations due to problems that have happened in specific sectors. That is one of the reasons to look at 10-year returns of many of the names. You will see wide divergences between one set of names and the other set of names and that is the reason it looks interesting from a lump sum point of view also. But we always believe a category like special situation does lend itself to systematic investment through SIP, STP as well.  Today it lends itself to interesting opportunities primarily because the last 10 years have not been normal. We had one of the most hated bull markets and in that hated bull market, there are names like consumers, retail banks and a few others which have done exceptionally well and the rest have done badly because of their own problems.  From a starting point of view, we seem to be in an interesting position. Having said that, clearly the challenge for category like special situation and is that people have to have a three-to-five year orientation and not a three-month orientation. That is the challenge we have in communication and that is how we hope investors today are matured enough to look for such high active share, products with a three to five year view.","Jan 01, 2019, 12:30 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/2019-january-much-better-for-stock-pickers-than-2018-january-s-naren-icici-pru-amc/articleshow/67333768.cms

MahaRERA dismisses realtor’s ‘slowdown’ argument for delays,"The developer informed that because of economic downturn, it could not sell flats and generate funds for construction of the project located in the northern fringes of Mumbai.","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority has refused to entertain realty developer Neelkamal Realtors’ argument of general economic slowdown for its inability to adhere to the delivery schedule it had promised the home buyers.The developer informed the authority that because of economic downturn/crises, it could not sell flats and generate funds for construction of the project located in the northern fringes of Mumbai.MahaRERA in its recent order said that the Indian economy has shown consistent growth over the last so many years without any major incidents of recession or inflation. Also, a builder should have sound knowledge of the industry. Thus, it didn’t consider this as one of the several reasons cited by the developer for delays, asking it instead to pay penal interest to home buyers.“…Having sound knowledge in the real estate sector, the developer was fully aware of the market risks when he launched the project and signed the agreement with home buyers. Moreover, the nation’s economy as a whole has shown consistent growth over the last so many years without any major incidents of recession or inflation,” said the MahaRERA order.Home buyers had moved the authority against the developer after it failed to deliver the apartments at its project DB Ozone in Mira Road near Mumbai in December 2015 even after the grace period of 12 months from the scheduled possession date. The developer, in its response, also pointed out that the project got delayed because of the ban on sand and stone mining. However, the authority rejected this argument as well.According to the authority, the ban was placed in 2007 and lifted in 2014. But the agreement was executed in 2013 and the developer was well aware of all these constraints, the order said.

3 sectors staring in the face with mouth-watering opportunities,"After a long time, we are seeing greenshoots in private capex, says Parmar","By Jiten ParmarI always look to invest in a company when I find it much below its intrinsic value. You call it contrarian investing, or whatever, the fact is it works most of the time, especially when there is an overall pessimism in a sector.Even managements are pessimistic in such times. That’s when you can buy a dollar worth of assets for, let’s say 40-50 cents or lower. And sell, when I get, let’s say for a couple of dollars.For 2019, the sectors that look interesting are capital goods, infrastructure (road construction mainly) and cement.After a long time, we are seeing greenshoots in private capex. As capacity utilisation levels have increased, we are seeing new private capex coming in at a faster pace.Capital goods and engineering as a theme looks promising at this point. This is evident from the increase in order flow of many of the companies. There is good demand from railways, metro, water and construction sectors. Order books showed this trend at end of September quarter.Automation as a theme has been doing well and will pick up more. I expect demand from power sector to ramp up. I am increasing allocation to this sector.Cement has had a very bad time, as it has been weighed down by high petcoke prices, loading norms, fuel cost for transportation and so on. And there has hardly been any price rise.During this lean period, many players acquired stressed assets or ramped up capacity utilisation, which did not allow selling prices to rise despite an increase in input costs.Demonetisation and GST also pushed demand lower. Real estate, which is one of the users of cement, has had a rough time. Basically, we have seen many things going wrong at the same time for the sector. Some of them are easing now. Modified loading norms, cooling crude oil prices and the resultant fall in transportation cost and a drop in petcoke prices are big positives for the sector. Also, most players have ramped up capacity utilisation levels of the stressed assets they acquired. New capacity addition is lesser than demand, which augurs well. Another positive can be if GST rates are reduced from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. Thus, this sector looks good for next 2-3 years. One has to be region-specific, as some regions might have a lot of capacity.I have been adding these stocks for last few months and plan to increase weight in this sector.The infrastructure sector remains beaten down. Many road construction players have halved, despite bagging good orders and getting financial closures for their projects.Look for players, which have been able to get financial closure despite challenging conditions in disbursements. Another point to track is whether any of the individual projects have land acquisition issues. There are a few players which have been able to mitigate these challenging conditions. These should do well going forward. Valuations are attractive. Be selective, though. I have been buying into this sector in last few months. Others Look, what 2019 might hold for you!(Jiten Parmar is a partner at investment advisory firm Aurum Capital. This should not be considered an investment advice.

"Commodity outlook: How to trade in crude oil, gold, silver and base metals today","​​ Cardamom futures is expected to hold the uptrend taking support near Rs 1,500 levels. 
","Gold was trading almost flat in morning trade on account of subdued demand for the precious metal from investors, retailers and jewellers. Silver was trading over 0.30 per cent down at Rs 38,705 per 1 kg.We bring you projections on various commodities from SMC Global Securities. Take a look: Spices: Turmeric futures (Apr) is expected to show upside momentum taking support near Rs 6,550 levels. Prices of turmeric in benchmark Nizamabad market of Telangana are up 7 per cent from a year ago in Rs 5,500-6,000 per 100 kg range even as arrivals of new crop have begun. Jeera futures (Jan) has taken support near Rs 17200 and from here an extended short covering can be seen towards Rs 17930 levels. Jeera prices traded firm at the benchmark markets of Gujarat and Rajasthan supported by some fresh buying emerged at the lower level. The prices went up by Rs 15-20 per 20 kg in Unjha, while turned better by Rs 100 per 100 kg in Rajasthan. Cardamom futures (Jan) is expected to hold the uptrend taking support near Rs 1,500 levels. Oilseeds: Soybean futures (Jan) is expected to witness a consolidation in the range of Rs 3,370-3,435 levels. Soybean traded firm at major spot markets across the country on some good buying from crushers and good domestic and export demand for soybean meal. Spot soybean edged up by Rs 25 to Rs 3,200-3,350 per 100 kg at the benchmark Indore market. Plant rates were also higher by Rs 15 to Rs 3,475. Soybean arrivals had dropped significantly in the country due to slow farmers selling at lower rates and they are waiting for appreciation in prices. Mustard futures (Jan) is expected to trade sideways in the range of Rs 3900-3950. Mustard seed prices gained further in the spot markets across Rajasthan helped by some revival in demand for mustard oil and mustard cake. Other commodities: Cotton futures (Jan) may trade sideways to down facing hesitance near Rs 20,945 levels. Cotton prices remained steady at the major markets across central and south India on Monday due to limited buying and selling activity despite firm futures and lower than expected supply. Activity in the market was thin due to slow buying by mills and exporters. Exporters buying in the region are slow on weak inquiry from overseas as rates are now at par with international market. Mills demand is hand to mouth also due to expectations of some more correction amid weak global outlook, followed by subdued inquiry in yarn market. Guar seed futures (Jan) is expected to witness short covering towards Rs 4400-4420 taking support near Rs 4225 levels, while guar gum futures (Jan) may remain stable above 8335 levels. Guarseed and Guargum price gained in major markets across Rajasthan due to strong cues from crude oil and dwindling supply. Gold and silver: Bullion counter may trade with sideways to upside bias as gold has regained its safe-haven appeal because of turmoil in financial markets. Gold can take support near Rs 31,200 and can face resistance near Rs 31,450 in MCX. While silver can take support near Rs 38,300 and can face resistance near Rs 39100. Base metals: Base metals prices may trade with weak bias tracking subdued international markets. Copper can face resistance near Rs 415 and can slip lower towards Rs 405-400 in MCX. Chile’s copper production touched 540,720 tonnes in November, its highest level in 13 years, as ore grades and efficient processing favored increased output in the world’s top producer of the red metal, the government said on Monday. Zinc can face resistance near Rs 175 and support near Rs 168. Lead can take support near Rs 138 and can face resistance near RS 142. Nickel can take support near Rs 730 while its upside will be capped near Rs 750. Aluminium can take support near Rs 125 levels while it has resistance near Rs 130 levels. Energy: Crude oil may trade with firm note as crude oil can test Rs 3,280 taking support near Rs 3,150 on MCX. US crude oil output hit an all-time high of more than 11.5 million barrels per day in October, according to government data released on Monday. Hints of progress on a possible US-China trade deal, with US President Donald Trump saying he had a “very good call” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, helped bolster sentiment for oil. For most of 2018, oil prices were on the rise, driven up by healthy demand and supply concerns, especially around the impact of renewed US sanctions against major producer Iran, which were introduced in early November.

"Maha govt, LIC to bid for Air India's iconic building","The debt-laden carrier had on December 10 issued a tender inviting bids from “government entities only for sale of lease hold rights of the land and its iconic AI building at Nariman Point, Mumbai.","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India has come to the aid of the national carrier Air India (AI), which is struggling to survive, by bidding for its iconic Nariman Point headquarters in Mumbai. The Maharashtra state government is the other bidder for this high-rise. Incidentally, both these entities already have their landmark offices — LIC Yogakshma, and Mantralaya, respectively — near the 23-storey AI building.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis confirmed that the Maharashtra government had put in a bid for acquiring the Air India building. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), which had earlier this year shown interest in acquiring the Maharaja’s crown jewel property, did not bid for it.The debt-laden carrier had on December 10 issued a tender inviting bids from “government entities only for sale of lease hold rights of the land and its iconic AI building at Nariman Point, Mumbai, on as is, where is basis”. The deadline for submitting the sealed bids was 2.30pm on December 31.“So far, only LIC and the state government of Maharashtra (have submitted their bids),” aviation secretary R N Choubey told TOI on Monday evening after the deadline lapsed. The response to the AI building is better than the failed bid to divest in the airline itself, which did not receive even a single bid earlier this year.It is not yet clear whether the government will go ahead with the LIC and Maharashtra government bids, or extend the deadline to allow more bids. Earlier this year, JNPT had shown interest in the high-rise. But the process could not go forward as a single party meant no bidding. The airline expects to raise about Rs 1,500 crore by selling the building. “The character of this iconic structure will be maintained, irrespective of ownership,” Choubey had recently told TOI.Sources say, given the tight market conditions, several government agencies have had to relax bidding norms for prime properties. A case in point is the Taj Mansingh Hotel in Delhi where civic agency NDMC had to eventually relax bidding norms by allowing two bidders to go ahead with the process of leasing it out for 33 years more this summer after several failed auctions. The AI building has also got two interested parties — that could enable a bidding, if the government so decides.AI currently retains five floors in this Queen’s Necklace marvel and gets about Rs 107 crore as annual rental from the rest. When the JNPT deal did not materialise, the airline planned to vacate some more floors and increase its annual rental to Rs 120-125 crore.","Jan 01, 2019, 12:15 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/maha-govt-lic-to-bid-for-air-indias-iconic-building/articleshow/67333636.cms
"If I were to pick a rebound story for 2019, it will be hotel industry",There was a sharp rise in average room rent (ARR) during 2002-2007 period.,"By Gaurav SudIndia’s hotel industry has been through a cyclical low over the past decade. This has turned many companies in the sector loss making, and the overall return on invested capital has been lousy. This can be attributed to many reasons.There was a sharp rise in average room rent (ARR) during 2002-2007 period. In metros like Delhi and Mumbai, it was difficult to get a five-star room for even Rs 20,000 per night in 2007. This led to amassive investment in hotel properties across India, which resulted in supply rising faster than demand, and eventually drove down utilisation levels and ARR in the following decade.Secondly, new digitial platforms like MakeMyTrip, GoIbibo, Yatra, ClearTrip became popular and allowed easy price discovery, which drove down the average ARR for larger chains as even smaller hotels started attracting a wider audience. Further more, in order to grow business, many of these digital platforms started offering big discounts to travellers, which impacted pricing power of larger hotel chains.Excessive taxation on the industry made larger hotel chains suffer at the cost of unorganised hotels, which were willing to cut corners by not paying taxes and thus became more competitive for the end user.Looking back, it looks like a perfect storm for the hospitality industry. But finally, there is light at the end of the tunnel. A number of factors are driving this revival, and the coming decade looks much better for the industry as a whole.Better road infrastructure, rising disposable income, propensity to travel over the weekends, e-visa facilitating foreign tourist arrivals, tax rationalisation are among the numerous factors driving demand for tourist and business travel.Since there has not been much investment in the hospitality industry in last few years, supply of new inventory is very limited. According to an ICRA report, demand is expected to grow 9-10 per cent in next four years vs 4-5 per cent supply growth. This, in turn, will drive the increase in ARR over the next few years.The long downturn has also lowered costs in the hospitality industry, as tracked by metrics like number of people employed and operating costs per room. In the coming years, the expected double-digit growth in ARR coupled with lower operating costs will drive profitability growth in the industry, helping them improve return ratios and deleverage balance sheets.This sector, as a whole, looks like a good investing bet for next five years.

New year will be beginning of Pakistan's golden era: Imran Khan,"Khan's promise of a ""golden era"" followed a similar message by army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor who termed 2019 as year of progress.","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday said the new year will be the beginning of Pakistan's golden era as he vowed to address the perennial issues of poverty, illiteracy, injustice and corruption in 2019.Khan took to microblogging site Twitter to greet people and share his New Year resolution with the countrymen.""Our New Year resolution is to wage jihad against the 4 ills of our country: poverty, illiteracy, injustice and corruption,"" he said.Khan further said that ""InshaAllah (God willing) 2019 is the beginning of Pakistan's golden era.""His government also slashed petroleum prices billed a New Year gift. Petrol was reduced by Rs4.86 per litre, setting the price at Rs90.97 per litre, while price of high speed diesel was slashed by Rs4.26 per litre to fix it at Rs196.68 per litre.The two variants of fuel are most commonly used in Pakistan.Khan's government came to power in August riding on the pledge of create Naya (new) Pakistan but so far struggled to give any major relief to the public.Its focus on accountability has already been receding into witch-hunt and the government was criticised by the Chief Justice on Monday for putting 172 people, including chief minister of Sindh province on a no-fly list after a probe into fake accounts.Similarly, a pledge to start constructing 5 million houses for low income groups in the first 100 days is no where in sight.Khan's promise of a ""golden era"" followed a similar message by army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor who termed 2019 as year of progress.""In our national pursuit for a peaceful, prosperous and vibrant Pakistan, 2019 is year of progress,"" said Ghafoor.

Many parts of this bimetal story make it a promising bet for 2019,The company exports its products to over 50 countries around the world.,"By Dhiraj DaveI like Shivalik Bimetal Controls as an investment idea for 2019.Shivalik Bimetal Controls is engaged in the business of manufacturing & sales of thermostatic bimetal/trimetal strips, components, EB-welded products, cold-bonded bimetal strips and parts.Promoted by SS Sandhu and NS Ghumman and incorporated in 1984, the company exports its products to over 50 countries around the world.Shivalik caters to broad spectrum of applications, including switchgears, energy meters, industrial use, electrical applications, besides automotive & electronic devices. Its revenue growth is dependent on electrical, electronics and automative Industries.  Others Despite single-digit revenue growth in main end-use industries in India, Shivalik reported 19 per cent CAGR growth during FY15-FY18 by improving product mix and increased penetration in export market. The growth in exports could be attributed to high research focus and superior quality of products achieved through experience in some processes. The company’s research facility was approved by Ministry of Science and technology in as early as 2002. Others During FY11-14, the company faced major setbacks as supply to colour picture tube (CPT) part, which contributed around 30% of its revenue in FY11, dwindled due to a change in technology resulting in virtually no demand for CPT parts. The share of CPT parts in Shivalik’s total revenue fell to almost nil (0.5 per cent of revenue) in FY14. In order to overcome the challenges, the company managed available cash flows prudently (curtailed dividend to nil from around two annual dividend payments a year in the past, delayed proposed capex for expansion and reoriented production facility manufacturing CRT parts to manufacture new products under development).Consistent efforts to improve new products and frugal cash flow management rewarded the company. New shunt developed by the company found its usage in battery management system for electrical vehicles and that resulted in improved share of shunt in total revenue.The management is also venturing into niche applications like overloaded protection and thermostatic Bimetals of various home appliances through JVs. It has also announced capex plan for manufacturing diverse products to meet growing demand of existing products and new products with applications in newer fields like smart meters and home appliances.When the company was going through a rough patch, directors had foregone 70 per cent of their entitlement, amounting to Rs 62.64 lakh in director remuneration and opted to avail only 30 per cent of the increased remuneration as approved the central government for the FY 2011-12. Further, in FY14, due to constrained profitability, the management voluntarily proposed to work on the same salary for next three year.However, in FY18, when the company resumed on profitable path, salaries of promoter directors increased to Rs 3.63 crore against a net profit of Rs 15.99 crore, which was higher than total dividend payment of Rs 2.77 crore during the year.The company has few joint ventures like Checon Shivalik Contact Solutions (Inlay manufacturing facility with Checon Corporation as equal JV Partner) and Innovative Clad Solutions (world-class manufacturing facility in field of clad metal with Aperam Group as major partner).Bulk of the company’s raw material is nickel-based alloys and other alloys. A significant quantity of input requirement is imported, which results in input price volatility risks. The company, however, mitigates same by having entering into contracts with customers, who provide for passing of any input cost change. Further, more than 50 per cent exports work as natural hedge against exchange rate movement on raw material cost.At trailing 12-month P/E of 20 times, the company is reasonably valued in view of the expected growth. However, given the innovative and diversified product mix, prospect for higher revenue growth may provide scope for price appreciation in the medium term.(Dave, a Mumbai-based value investor, holds shares in the company.

Delhi's air quality in 'severe' category for third consecutive day,"Nineteen areas in Delhi recorded 'severe' pollution, while 14 witnessed 'very poor' air quality, the CPCB data showed. ","NEW DELHI: For the third consecutive day, the air quality in the national capital was in the severe category on Tuesday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the overall air quality index (AQI) in the national capital on New Year's Day was 404, while the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) recorded an AQI of 405, both of which are under the 'severe' category. Nineteen areas in Delhi recorded 'severe' pollution, while 14 witnessed 'very poor' air quality, the CPCB data showed. Ghaziabad and Noida recorded 'severe' air quality, while in Faridabad and Gurgaon recorded it was in the 'very poor' category. The overall PM2.5 level (fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometer) was recorded at 280 and the PM10 level at 465 in Delhi, the CPCB said. The SAFAR has said the air quality would improve slightly ""provided that no additional local emissions are added on New Year eve"". ""Any new trigger in terms of additional local emission, particularly from open fire, pyrotechnic display and fossil fuel burning may make air heavier and thick with low ventilation, and may lead to rapid deterioration in air quality to severe-plus range,"" the SAFAR said. But despite warnings, several instances of firecracker bursting, before and after the time limit fixed by the apex court, were observed in Delhi-NCR during New Year celebrations. The SAFAR said the air quality in Delhi is likely to remain in the 'severe' zone for the next two days as weather conditions are more adverse now. ""The deterioration in speed of moisture-laden wind from west may become fatal at this stage and any new trigger, in terms of local emission, particularly from open fires, firecrackers and (burning of) fossil fuels will fast deteriorate the air quality and keep it in the 'severe' category,"" it said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) and SAFAR said the air quality is likely to remain in the 'severe' category owing to low wind speed, which is highly unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The authorities warned that moderate fog and emissions during night hours may result in deterioration of the air quality and this situation may prevail till Wednesday. The SAFAR also pointed out that a consistent day-night trend is being observed for the past one week. ""During night, a combination of calm wind and colder condition is elevating the pollution level.

India imports 60 per cent — 15.5 million tonnes annually — of its edible oil requirements, largely from Malaysia, Indonesia, Argentina and Ukraine.The duty on crude palm oil from Malaysia, Indonesia and other members of the Association of South East Asian Nations was cut to 40 per cent from 44 per cent, while the tax on refined palm oil was cut to 45 per cent from 54 per cent if imported from Malaysia and to 50 per cent, if purchased from Indonesia or other member-nations of Asean, the ministry of finance said in a ministry notification issued on Monday.The industry said the duty reduction would lead to increased imports of palm oil and it was too early to say if Indian consumers would benefit. The Solvent Extractors Association said that the duty cut, effective from Tuesday, would impact the domestic palm oil refining industry and hit oil palm cultivation. The industry pegs the country’s edible oil consumption at 23.5 million tonnes for 2018-19 and expects to import 15.5 million tonnes, with 60 per cent from Malaysia and Indonesia, followed by soyabean oil from Argentina and Brazil, sunflower oil from Ukraine and Russia and canola oil from Canada.With 8 million tonnes of palm oil imported annually, domestic production was only 3,00,000 tonnes, the Solvent Extractors Association said.“This decision of government is contrary to the ‘Make in India’ efforts and would also seriously stymie the efforts at improving palm cultivation in the country. This will also harm the interests of the oilseed farmer who was lately getting enthused with relatively high import duties. We hope the government of India would realise the situation and take appropriate steps to save oil palm plantations and palm oil refiners,” said Atul Chaturvedi, president of the Solvent Extractors Association.With the rupee strengthening to Rs 69.50 from Rs 74.40 against the dollar and international markets at a 6-7 year low, edible oil prices were at the lowest, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of oil consultancy firm Sunvin Group.“It’s early to say if consumers will further benefit from this move. However, with the difference between crude and refined palm oil reducing from 10 per cent to now 5 per cent, refineries in the country will face a difficult time,” he said.","Jan 02, 2019, 10:25 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/india-cuts-tax-on-palm-oil-imports-malaysia-to-gain-most/articleshow/67344591.cms

Nearly 60% buyers say ‘No’ to GST for under-construction properties: Poll,The revelation comes when the GST Council is likely to reduce the GST rate levied on under-construction properties to 5% from 12% in its January 2019 meeting.,"NEW DELHI: In a recent poll conducted by Magicbricks, around 57% home buyers have said that they do not want to pay Goods and Services Act (GST) at all for under construction properties. Buyers say that they are already paying registration and stamp duty charges to the state government hence GST is an additional burden for them.The revelation comes at a time when the GST council is likely to reduce the GST rate levied on under-construction properties to 5% from the current 12% in its January 2019 meeting.Ready-to-move-in properties are exempted from GST which is why many buyers continue to prefer completed projects.“The home buyer sees GST as one more in a plethora of taxation being imposed on home purchase. Obviously, Indian real estate is awaiting full implementation of GST in real estate with all levies, cess and taxes being subsumed into a single tax – GST, and that is the ultimate goal. At present, if GST levels can be substantially lowered or totally done away with in the under construction stage, home buyers will definitely see it as a positive move,” says Niranjan Hiranandani, president, National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO).Taxes for under-construction propertiesAccording to Anarock, statutory and legal costs for under construction properties vary between 15-20%, depending on the state in question, and broadly includes stamp duty, registration and GST.“The overall costs involved in buying a property can be divided into two components –first being the one paid to the builder/seller and second the statutory and legal costs paid to the government. While the former roughly comprises 80-85% of the overall property cost, the remaining 15-20% goes as taxes to the government coffers,” explains Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants.Stamp duty: Stamp duty is paid on the sale agreement to render a property transaction legal, and this varies from state to state. For example, in Maharashtra, the stamp duty is 5% (now proposed to be 6%), while in Karnataka it is currently 5.6%. As such, stamp duty accounts for between 5-7% of the total property acquisition cost. Interestingly, most states offer a rebate of 1-2% to women if a property is registered in their name.Registration charges: To register a sale agreement with the registration officer, buyers have to pay a registration fee of 1% on the total cost of the property at the district sub-registrar’s office.GST: Under the new tax-regime implemented in 2017, under construction properties are currently taxed at 12% on the base cost of a property. Most recently, the GST council is mulling to reduce this rate, with many anticipating it to be reduced to either 8% or 5%. Thus, check the prevailing rate at the time of purchase.Tax deducted at source (TDS): TDS is charged at 1% for properties priced below Rs 50 lakh. It is deducted by the buyer at the time of payment to the seller. Thereafter, the builder needs to pay this amount to the central government. This can be paid online or via any authorised bank within seven days from the end of the month in which such TDS is deducted.Nevertheless, if the GST council reduces the current rate on under construction properties then it will be a major relief for home buyers who are planning to buy property in 2019. It will also bring a big relief for the real estate industry which is awaiting more initiatives from the government to boost the sector.","Jan 01, 2019, 01:15 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/nearly-60-buyers-say-no-to-gst-for-under-construction-properties-poll/articleshow/67334153.cms
India remains fastest growing economy ahead of China despite up/downs,"According to Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar, the focus of the government in 2019 will be to expedite reforms with a view to accelerate growth. ","NEW DELHI: India remained ahead of China to retain the tag world's fastest growing large economy withstanding several ups and downs, spike in oil prices and global trade war like situation during 2018.Indian economy's roller-coaster ride during the year gone by was best captured by the GDP growth. In the first quarter of 2018-19 ending June 30, it grew at an impressive 8.2 per cent, after 7.7 per cent in the first three months of the year.Then it slipped to 7.1 per cent in the next quarter ending September 30. Fitch Ratings slashed India's GDP growth forecast to 7.2 per cent for the current fiscal, from 7.8 per cent projected in September, citing higher financing cost and reduced credit availability.According to Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar, the focus of the government in 2019 will be to expedite reforms with a view to accelerate growth.""India will grow at around 7.8 per cent in the next calendar year and investment cycle that has already started picking-up will gather further strength and we will see more private investments,"" Kumar said.Experts, however, expect that moderating growth can force the government to spend more before the next general elections and that could lead to fiscal pressures.Global factors such as sudden zoom in crude prices (which are now easing), strengthening US dollar, slowing growth in the wake of US-China trade war and the US Federal Reserve hiking interest rate for the fourth time in a year did take the toll on India's economy.The banking sector ruled the headlines in 2018. The year opened with India's biggest banking scam coming to light. On February 14, state-owned Punjab National Bank said it had detected a Rs 11,400 crore scam where billionaire-jeweller Nirav Modi allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking from a branch in Mumbai to secure overseas credit from other Indian lenders.The case has gathered a long political traction, with the government making little progress in bringing back the absconding accused.The year ended with a rare face-off between the Reserve Bank of India and the Central government. Urjit Patel's resignation a few weeks later was seen as a culmination of the tussle in December.The main trigger was government's demand to relax restrictions on weak public-sector lenders, which slowed down credit growth. For the first time, the government threatened to use its special powers under Section 7 of the RBI Act. The cycle of events at the RBI brought to the fore concerns about the RBI's autonomy.The RBI-government tussle sent shock waves far and wide. The country's leading infrastructure finance company IL&FS defaulted on payments to lenders. It triggered panic among a large number of investors, banks and mutual funds associated with the company.The IL&FS defaults were even being seen as India's Lehman Brothers moment that had triggered the global financial crisis in 2008. The government wanted the RBI to provide relief to non-banking finance companies impacted by the IL&FS defaults.However, the economy witnessed a big positive development — the progress made under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Tasked with helping recover unpaid corporate loans, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has helped resolve insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings involving more than Rs 60,000 crore (during Apirl-September 2018-19), and the kitty is expected to swell beyond Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019 with several big-ticket default cases pending.A rapidly depreciating rupee and steeply rising petrol prices played havoc with India's current account deficit (CAD). It widened to 2.9 per cent of the GDP in the second quarter of the fiscal compared to 1.1 per cent in the year-ago period, mainly due to a large trade deficit.""The widening of the current account deficit amidst tighter global financing conditions should put downward pressure on the currency, and we forecast the INR to weaken to 75 against the dollar by end-2019,"" said rating agency Fitch in a report.A good news for the economy was India's improved ranking on the World Bank's 'ease of doing business' report for the second straight year, jumping 23 places to the 77th position on the back of reforms related to insolvency, taxation and other areas.Collection of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in October, after a gap of five months, but again slipped below the mark to Rs 97,637 crore in November. Yet, it was higher than the average monthly collection in the year. Steady increase in average collection raised hopes of monthly collection to remain above Rs 1 lakh crore next year.Inflation has remained well below the forecasts by the RBI, which targets to keep inflation at 4 per cent in the medium term. During the April-October period, industrial output grew 5.6 per cent as compared to 2.5 per cent in the same period of the previous fiscal. In October, it stood at a 11-month high of 8.1 per cent.On inflation, Dun & Bradstreet in a report said: Going forward, there are concerns over fiscal slippage due to likely expenditure on pre-poll sops before the Lok Sabha elections next year. The Congress party's promise of universal farm loan waiver, if it comes to power is likely to force the hand of the BJP government, which has so far stuck to fiscal prudence.Having witnessed controversy over host of issues like demonetisation, implementation of GST and the government's handling of banking sector woes, the year also witnessed political slugfest over revised GDP data, which showed that growth during the previous Congress-led UPA's regime was less than what was estimated earlier.Recalibrating data of past years, using 2011-12 as the base year instead of 2004-05, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) lowered the country's economic growth rate during the previous Congress-led UPA's regime.Economists, including former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian, had questioned the involvement of the Niti Aayog in release of GDP back series data and had also called for review by experts to clear doubts over the data.","Jan 01, 2019, 04:54 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-remains-fastest-growing-economy-ahead-of-china-despite-up/downs/articleshow/67334194.cms

Sabarimala row: Lakhs to form 'women's wall' in Kerala,Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran told reporters Tuesday that government employees would also be participating in the women's wall.,"Lakhs of women from various walks of life would be participating in the 620 km-long state-sponsored ""Women's wall"" campaign stretching from the northern tip of Kasaragod to the southern end here Tuesday to uphold gender equality and renaissance values. The ""Women's wall"" was conceived in the backdrop of frenzied protests witnessed in the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala after the CPI(M)-led LDF government decided to implement the Supreme Court verdict, allowing all women to pray at the Ayyappa shrine. While Health minister K K Shylaja would lead the chain at Kasargod, senior CPM leader Brinda Karat would be the last person at the end of the chain in Thiruvananthapuram. Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran told reporters Tuesday that government employees would also be participating in the women's wall. ""Government employees will also be taking part in the initiative.All arrangements are in place in order to avoid traffic snarls in the state,"" Surendran said. LDF is expecting over 30 lakh women to take part in the event. Preparations are almost over as state ministers and district collectors are in charge to make the initiative a big success and all efforts are being made to streamline any hiccups. Schools in some districts have declared holiday in the afternoon while Universities have postponed examinations which were to be held Tuesday amid allegations of misuse of official machinery, which the LDF has denied. The participants would gather at the designated centers on Tuesday at 3.30 PM, when a rehearsal would be held. The Wall would be formed between 4 and 4.15 PM, with participants taking a pledge to uphold gender equality and renaissance values. The Women's wall was suggested at a meeting called by the Kerala government following the massive protests by right-wing parties and a section of devotees over the government's decision to implement the September 28 apex court order, allowing women of all ages to offer prayers at Sabarimala. ""The protests by communal forces against women's entry in Sabarimala had prompted the government and other progressive organisations to conceive the idea of a Women's Wall in the state,"" Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan said. Women, cutting across caste and religion, would join the wall ""to save Kerala from the being dragged back into the era of darkness, he said. The participants would also be taking a pledge for upholding gender equality and renaissance values. Though a controversy had erupted following reports that the government had set apart Rs 50 crore for the event, the Chief Minister had categorically denied it saying no government fund would be utilised for the same. The event is being organised by the ruling LDF along with over 176 other socio-political organisations, including the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) and Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS). Over 1.25 lakh volunters of the Kudambashree Mission, would also be participating. Leader of Opposition in the assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, has described the initiative as a 'wall of contradiction', while UDF MLA M K Muneer has termed it as a 'communal' wall for inviting participation only from 'progressive Hindu organisations'. The Nair Service Society (NSS), a prominent organization of the upper caste Nair community, and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) are among those who are not participating. To counter the Women's wall, thousands of volunteers of Sabarimala Karma Samithi and other right wing groups, BJP and RSS and NSS had lit Ayyappa Jyothies (lighting of sacred lamps) across the state on December 26. Many prominent personalities, including film actors, from all spheres of life are expected to take part in the event.","Jan 01, 2019, 02:10 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sabarimala-row-lakhs-to-form-womens-wall-in-kerala/articleshow/67334259.cms
Railway ministry to take action against officer for defamatory article on Piyush Goyal,Kumar has been vocal in raising concerns related to the alleged wrong functioning of some wings of the Railway ministry. ,"The Railway ministry has decided to take disciplinary action against Union minister Jitendra Singh's OSD for casting aspersions against its minister Piyush Goyal and questioning the wisdom of senior government officials in an article, according to official documents. Railway Board Secretary Ranjanesh Sahai has written to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) asking for the immediate repatriation of Sanjiv Kumar, a 2005 batch officer of the Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS) for ""breach of official decorum and misconduct"". Kumar is the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to Jitendra Singh, who holds multiple portfolios, including minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office and for Development of North Eastern Region. ""A case of breach of official decorum and misconduct of Sanjiv Kumar, IRPS, has been brought to the notice of railway board. Sanjiv Kumar has authored an article, published by www.railsamachar.com and www.nationalwheels.com,"" Sahai wrote in his letter to the DoPT. The article, besides being in bad taste, questions the wisdom of senior functionaries of the level of secretary to the government of India and also casts aspersions on the Minister of Railways (Piyush Goyal), it said. ""...it is proposed to take up the officer under the Railway Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968. You would appreciate that a misconduct of this nature and that too in the public domain would send a wrong message all around and encourage indiscipline in the service,"" the letter dated December 28, 2018, said. Sahai asked DoPT Secretary C Chandramouli ""to consider immediate repatriation of Sanjiv Kumar, IRPS, to this ministry for taking action as deemed appropriate"". It added that the issue had the approval of the Railway Board chairman. Ashwani Lohani retired as Railway Board chairman on Monday. Kumar has been vocal in raising concerns related to the alleged wrong functioning of some wings of the Railway ministry. ""The article written by Kumar clearly mentions that all is not good in the Railway ministry. It needs immediate intervention of the Prime Minister's Office,"" said an officer requesting anonymity. The Railway ministry has internally transferred another officer for allegedly raising concerns on cadre related issues. Chetan Prakash Jain, a 1994 batch IRPS officer, executive director, Establishment (GC) has been appointed executive director, Establishment (G), which officials say is a less significant charge. Anand Singh Khati has been appointed in his post, officials said, citing an order. On December 14, Jain, along with some other officials, presented a memorandum to Singh, who is also minister of state for Personnel, saying the Railway Board has not agreed with the recommendation of Cadre Review Committee (CRC) for keeping the post of 'member staff' exclusively for IRPS officers. IRPS officers and senior Railway Board functionaries were at loggerheads after the letter, officials said.","Jan 01, 2019, 03:28 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/railway-min-wants-action-officer-for-article-against-piyush-goyal/articleshow/67334519.cms
"2019 to augur very well for PSU banks, specially SBI: Dinesh Kumar Khara","
“Shashakt, which is a resolution platform outside IBC is also expected to be activated in 2019.”","The pace of NPA resolution expected to get further accelerated in 2019, Dinesh Kumar Khara, MD, SBI, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: What are your expectations from 2019? Would problem areas ease a bit?Well, of course. As far as 2019 is concerned, it is a year full of hope and towards the latter half of 2018, we started seeing NPA issues approaching resolution and that is a very positive sign. As far as NPAs are concerned, many of the borrowers have started coming forward offering resolutions much before the accounts are turning NPAs.  Partly, it is also on account of the February 12th circular wherein the banks are required to start monitoring from SMA zero level and it comes under the radar as far as the stressed assets are concerned. Naturally, on the part of borrowers there is an attempt to ensure that they are in a position to manage their cash flows better and avoid any kind of a default situation. Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  State Bank of India  moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis » I would say that the behaviour on the part of the borrower has improved significantly and the pace of resolution which was seen towards the latter half of 2018, is expected to get further accelerated in 2019. It will augur very well for the public sector banks in general and for State Bank in particular. Experts believe that stressed asset recognition cycle is nearing the end. Do you think that 2019 could be an inflection point because already the figure of one Rs 1 lakh crore recovery from IBC is being talked about in 2019? We are hoping for that and I would say that whatever resolutions have gone through the IBC last year, the resolution percentage is almost as high as 46%. That is a very positive sign and if you look at the system level provisioning also, to a greater extent, public sector banks have insulated themselves by providing adequately for all the NPAs which have been referred to the IBC.  Apart from that, we are also hoping that in the current year, Shashakt, which is actually a resolution platform outside IBC is also expected to be activated in 2019. I am sure that some of the assets can be resolved even outside the IBC process as well with the help of Shashakt in 2019. With the government announcing a recapitalisation for the banking sector, could we finally see some spurt in credit growth? The second half of 2018 onwards, we are witnessing an increase in the credit growth as far as State Bank of India is concerned. Even at the system level also, the credit growth is higher than that of deposit growth. In case of State Bank of India, there is about 14% credit growth that we have seen. As far as the deposit growth is concerned, it is somewhere around 7%-8%. I would say we expect a similar kind of a growth trajectory in 2019 as well. The sectors which have witnessed the growth include infrastructure like the road sector in particular and we are also seeing some kind of a growth in the cement sector. Apart from that, NBFCs and the services sector also have witnessed a growth but yes, NBFCs have gone through a tough phase in 2018 and naturally the banks have become very particular in terms of ensuring the quality of lending.They are very careful in terms of selecting the risk. But nevertheless, the good quality NBFCs are in a position to raise money from the banking sector. Reports are suggesting that the process to appoint merchant bankers for a Rs 20000 crore QIP have already been initiated by SBI. Yes, this is more like an enabling provision which has been put in place and we will be watchful in terms of the market conditions and also if we continue to see the growth trajectory because as of now, we are quite comfortable in terms of our capital adequacy but if we continue to see the growth trajectory, going forward we will be approaching the capital market also and raise the money from the capital market. How would you see lending and deposit rates moving in 2019? Could 2019 finally be the year of net interest margin improvement? Considering the current growth in credit, we are quite hopeful that we will continue to witness A similar kind of growth going forward also. Normally, as far as the interest rate scene is concerned, I would say that we are expecting there would be some rate cut February onwards because the inflation numbers have already come to about 2.3% and it will have an impact because when it comes to RBI and the last MPC decision in terms of their calibrated tapering, that is what they had indicated. But now since the inflation numbers have come to 2.3%, we are hoping that it will come to a situation where the policy rates might come down and if the policy rates comes down, we are hoping that there will be a softening of the MCLR, Normally I would say the lending rate a function of the deposit rate more than anything else. As I just mentioned, the lending growth is much higher as compared to deposit growth. It might have an impact on the deposit rates partially and that might impact the lending rates also. But eventually, I feel that with the policy rates coming down, at least we are hoping at least another 50 bps reduction in the policy rates in the year 2019. With the jolt that the NBFC sector got, could there be some business shifting to banking space and you being the largest, could that help in improving growth trades for you in the near term? As far as the NBFC sector is concerned, it is quite a dispersed sector. But some of the NBFCs are actually very good. I would say that those which are good, which are in a position to have a balanced ALM and are in a position to raise long-term liabilities and have a multiple source of funding, they would be much better placed in the year to come. The other NBFCs may eventually have a business model where whatever they are underwriting will probably be offered as a pool purchase to various banks, That kind of a model will probably help them sustain their operations going forward.  It is going to come through. We are expecting that even the regulator might come out with some kind of ALM norms which are as granular as it is for the banking system. If we really analyse the problems faced by NBFC sector, it is more to do with the quality of the liquidity not the liquidity per se. So I think that quality of liquidity aspect will get addressed if at all regulator comes out with their granular prescriptions for the ALM. We have also seen a lot of states announcing farm loan waivers which is not good for credit discipline and could strain the banking sector. Do you see this as a big threat stepping into election year? On the part of the banking system also there is a conscious effort about how to go for the asset-backed loans in the agri sector and also to go for the gold loan. So basically, risk mitigated products are something which are becoming the focus for many of the commercial banks. Going forward, when it comes to agri loans waiver, there are certain concerns but at the same time, banks are also trying to get into a space which remains commercially viable for them. And how soon can we expect a divestment like stake sale in SBI Life? How much funds do you expect to raise if indeed it happens in 2019? Divestment in the non-core sector is something which has been talked about. We have identified a few such opportunities and are looking for raising money in 19-20. We have done it in the past also and we will continue to maintain our efforts for raising money through the subsidiaries where we have invested over a period of time. Our ability of raising money will also be a function of the market situation at that point of time, but yes, at least some of the opportunities are being actively perceived by us.","Jan 01, 2019, 02:07 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/2019-to-augur-very-well-for-psu-banks-specially-sbi-dinesh-kumar-khara-sbi/articleshow/67334575.cms

"Hold some cash, 2019 should throw up many opportunities","The recent drop in bond yields should only provide a fillip to the said tailwinds.
","By Prabhakar KudwaCorporate and large PSU banks provide excellent risk-reward at this juncture for investors. Their earnings have remained supressed over the past few years due to several challenges due to asset quality issues and a rate tightening cycle.With the bulof bad assets already recognised and respective watch lists shrinking, there is a case for a sharp jump in profits for these companies. NCLT resolutions should drive healthy writebacks and will help compensate for provisioning requirements going ahead.The recent drop in bond yields should only provide a fillip to the said tailwinds.One can take a basket approach and own the large corporate and large PSU banks. It’s important to note that this is mean reversion at play, and by no means should one consider these as long-term buys and hold core positions. Structurally, fundamentals of PSU banks will always remain in turmoil, as they are used as political tools from time to time.One key risk will be the implementation of a widespread farm loan waiver (or some populist action) at a large scale as one goes into the general elections.Asset Allocation for 2019Given the current backdrop one should definitely increase allocation towards NiftyNext and midcap funds. Nifty50 has become a consensus trade with the top ten stocks driving most of the gains. This is likely to moderate in the New Year.Having said that, one should keep some cash at hand as we go into an election year. This cash should be deployed as we get closer to the election and post the election result based on the opportunities that the market provides.One should also keep an eye on global markets, which seem to be in their own turmoil and this cash should come in handy in case of any correction due to global factors.Overall, one should do well with a mix of aggressive (look beyond nifty 50) and defensive (hold cash) positions going into the next year. The middle path of owning only the large names may not be optimal from a risk-reward perspective; more so because it seems to be the consensus right now.The exact percentage allocations will differ from investor to investor based on their risk-appetite, liquidity profiles and conviction levels.

Calendar 2019 will be a year for systematic investing; here’s why,"Several uplifting factors are keeping the market upbeat, says Naren.","By Sankaran NarenCalendar 2019 is likely to be an interesting year for investors, as the market braces for near-term volatility owing the major near-term event of general elections. As on date, the Indian equity market is fairly valued; it is neither cheap nor expensive. More importantly, the focus now is on individual stock picking, as plenty of opportunities are available at attractive valuations. Several uplifting factors are keeping the market upbeat. To begin with, the fall is crude oil prices has been a sentiment booster, as it has greatly reduced the pressure on the twin deficits - current account and fiscal. Consequently, the rupee turned around from 74 to the dollar to 70 now. Bond yields, too, are coming off, lowering the interest burden on the economy. Above all, macro figures are once again showing signs of financial stability. From a near- to medium-term perspective, the equity market is likely to remain volatile. This is because, historically election years have proved to be volatile for financial markets in general. In the past, across election years of 2004, 2009 and 2014, the stock market has provided investors with intermittent opportunities to invest. During such times, the best investment strategy is to use the systematic investment route to accumulate equities. We believe 2019 too will be a year to systematically accumulate equities through SIP and STPs, keeping emotional biases at bay. Such accumulation phase generally comes as a precursor to a bull run. Thus, it is important to be patient and remain invested through this phase to make outsized gains in a likely market uptick, which ensues such a phase.  The most recent example of this phase was from 2010 to 2013. During this period, stock markets were largely range-bound. But for those investors who stayed invested, the rewards came in the years 2014 to 2017, when the stock market entered the bull phase. Amidst all these, investors need to watchful of a few factors. To begin with, US Fed’s stance on interest rates will be a factor to watch. A meaningful rally in Indian equities is likely only when the US Fed is done with its tightening. Along with this, the accumulation phase too is likely to come to an end. Keeping in view this stance, we believe, the current investing climate is conducive for investors to initiate or continue with systematic investment in equity assets such as smallcaps, midcaps and value funds. For those looking for making lumpsum investments, balanced advantage funds and equity savings funds should be the preferred vehicles. Such fund categories have exposure to both equity and debt, and thus, provide a margin of safety if things get choppy. In terms of themes, we are positive on special situations and those benefitting from volatility. In debt, dynamic duration schemes which can benefit from volatility, low duration funds that tend to mitigate interest rate volatility (investing in instruments with maturity in the range of 1-3 years) along with accrual schemes, which can capture the current elevated yields, are the categories we are positive on.

"ATF price cut by 14.7%; costs less than petrol, diesel",This is the second straight monthly reduction in rates and the biggest single cut ever.,"NEW DELHI: Jet fuel price Tuesday was cut by a record 14.7 per cent on the back of decline in international rates, making it cheaper than both petrol and diesel. The price of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) -- used to power airplanes -- was slashed by Rs 9,990 per kilolitre, or 14.7 per cent, to Rs 58,060.97 per kl, according to price notification issued by state-owned oil firms. This is the second straight monthly reduction in rates and the biggest single cut ever. Prices were slashed by Rs 8,327.83 per kl, or 10.9 per cent, on December 1. The two consecutive price reduction has brought ATF rates to their lowest levels in a year and will provide much-needed relief to cash-strapped airlines. Rates are now cheaper than both petrol and diesel in most parts of the country and it is less expensive than even non-PDS kerosene in cities like Mumbai. A litre of petrol, used in motorcycles and cars, costs Rs 68.65 in Delhi as compared to Rs 58,060.97 per kl or Rs 58.06 per litre price for ATF. A litre of diesel, which is mostly used as fuel in trucks and buses, comes for Rs 62.66. ATF costs just a shade higher than the price charged for kerosene sold through non-PDS (public distribution system) outlets in Delhi. Non-PDS in Delhi is priced at Rs 56.59 per litre. ATF in Mumbai, home to one of the busiest airport in the country, costs Rs 58,017.33 per kl or Rs 58.01 per litre. A litre of petrol in the city costs Rs 74.30 and diesel is priced at Rs 65.56 per litre. It costs less than even non-PDS kerosene in the city which is sold at Rs 59.53 a litre. Rates vary from city to city depending on local taxes. Continuing its downward march, petrol price Tuesday was cut by 19 paise a litre and diesel rates were reduced by 20 paise. Petrol now costs Rs 68.65 a litre in Delhi and diesel is priced at Rs 62.66. Rates have been on the decline since October 18 and cumulatively prices have been cut by Rs 14.18 per litre in case of petrol and Rs 13.03 a litre for diesel. State-owned fuel retailers revise rates of ATF on 1st of every month based on average international oil rate and rupee-US dollar exchange rate in the preceding month. Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis.","Jan 01, 2019, 03:16 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/atf-price-cut-by-14-7-costs-less-than-petrol-diesel/articleshow/67334854.cms
2019 a crucial year for Brand Modi,The 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be a referendum on Modi’s work as Prime Minister in the last five years.,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will face perhaps the biggest challenge of his political career in 2019 when he fights a buoyant Congress-led Opposition for another term, and shows his diplomatic skills in accommodating present alliance partners and winning new friends. The 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be a referendum on Modi’s work as Prime Minister in the last five years. He launched many welfare schemes, repackaged some from the previous dispensation and his government has claimed on every occasion that these measures have reached more people than in any previous regime. These claims will be put to test when BJP goes to the electorate in the April-May elections.The Prime Minister will also have to reinvent himself as a coalition builder this year and shed his “presidential” style of functioning. Till now Modi has worked as a one-man army who keeps himself above the party. Those close to him maintain that he is a good listener but takes his own decisions. His ministers have little role in decision making and mostly follow the diktat of their boss.As the opposition parties join hands to take on the saffron brigade and the anti-incumbency takes effect, BJP and its present NDA partners may fall short of the majority mark. In such a scenario, BJP will have to look for new post poll allies who would demand their pound of flesh.Modi and his trusted lieutenant Amit Shah do not have the reputation of taking allies along and most NDA partners have sulked in the last four and a half years. Shah has begun placating the allies and walking the extra mile to keep them in the NDA fold. Modi may have to make some effort to get new partners after the elections.The bigger hurdle for Modi may come when the prospective allies demand that they will support the BJP provided he is not the Prime Minister. Modi has the image of a Hindu hardliner despite his “sabka saath, sabka vikas” slogan. His polarising speeches during elections undo some of the statements he has made during peace time. With BJP fighting a tough general election, there are clear signs that it will play up the Hindutva card.Though the hypothesis of 'Modi not being PM if BJP falls short of numbers but is close to poll position' comes into play only after elections, it is not being ruled out in political circles. Some senior leaders in the BJP fancy their chances of stepping into Modi’s shoes in such a scenario. Murmurs about which BJP leader enjoys more acceptability across parties are heard often in political circles these days.Modi is BJP’s biggest hope in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and the party is banking heavily on his popularity. Even in states where the BJP lost Assembly elections, many voters still said they may vote for him in the general elections. However, the invincibility of the BJP under Modi has been shattered due to these defeats.BJP has lost Assembly elections in Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh post 2014. In Karnataka, a post-poll alliance between Congress and JD(S) kept BJP out of power. That the recent election defeats have been at the hands of the Congress in a direct fight is worrisome for BJP.The Modi versus Rahul Gandhi presidential form of contest in the elections that BJP hopes for is also not a cakewalk anymore. The jibes against Gandhi do not evoke the same support now. Gaffes on the part of Modi and other BJP leaders and election defeats at the hands of the Congress since Gandhi became party chief have blunted these attacks.Gandhi has also not shied away from directly attacking Modi. In the Lok Sabha, he took the PM by surprise when he walked up to him and gave him a hug. He has made an unrelenting attack on Modi on the Rafale and Nirav Modi issues. His “suit-boot ki Sarkar” and “Chowkidar chor hai” remarks against the PM forced BJP on the backfoot.But Modi is known for springing a surprise on his opponents, and his die-hard supporters are hopeful he will pull out a rabbit before the 2019 elections. All eyes are on him.","Jan 01, 2019, 04:55 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/2019-a-crucial-year-for-brand-modi/articleshow/67334853.cms
"Expect a good second half despite a muted Q3: Ajith Kumar Rai, Suprajit Engineering","
The currency fluctuation will be aiding us favourably in our P&L, says Suprajit CMD.","We continue to be hopeful and confident that in next year also, we will be in the 14-16% EBITDA band, Ajith          Kumar Rai, CMD, Suprajit Engineering, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: How is the three-brand strategy shaping up and the growth that it is likely to yield over the long term? The year gone by has been pretty good for us although the last two-three months have been somewhat tepid. However, our three-brand strategy – one for the automotive space, one for the non-automotive space and one for the lamps -- had good traction. We continue to believe that although our first half growth has been somewhat lesser than our normal pace, we still believe that second half will be good despite a muted Q3. Our aftermarket has been solid, our automotive exports have been solid and there has been good traction in the non-automotive space. Overall, we have had a good quarter. With the dollar-rupee now reversing in our favour, rupee has come down from 73 to about 70, below 70 as of last day of the year. The currency fluctuation also will be aiding us favourably in our P&L. We see a pretty good time so far, and going forward we expect to continue to have a robust business.Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Suprajit Engineering Ltd  moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis » For the revenue mix that you are looking at currently, how are you positioning yourself? We are fairly well split in the two-wheeler space. On a consolidated basis, our spilt will be about 33-34% and I would say about 20% to 22% in after market in the automotive as well as in the non-automotive space. We have a fairly well-balanced product and sector mix. About 10 years ago, we were 95% in the two-wheeler space. Now even in terms of global and Indian business, our Indian business will be about 58% to 60% while 40% will be our global business. That 40% is expected to grow robustly in the next two-three years. We expect we will go to 50-50 in the next two-three years’ time. Because of currency fluctuations, what is the expectation on margin performance? Our margin guidance at the EBITDA level on a consolidated basis is between 14% to 16%. In the first half, it was 14.5%, about 75 bps point below our last year’s performance. But over the end of the year, we will be in the same band, somewhat higher than where we were in the first half. It is just that in the last two-three years, our margins were closer to 16% but we are well within our range. We continue to be hopeful and confident that in next year also, we will be in the 14-16% EBITDA band. How is the scenario looking like in the second half, in light of the muted auto demand? Q3 has been muted for the Indian OEM automotive manufacturers. Up to November, the automotives have grown only about 2-3% whereas two-wheelers still clocked about 11% or 12%. Within the two-wheelers, two of the top four are with the single digit growth whereas the other two had a significant double digit performance.  Since we are working with all the players for us also on the OEM business side there has been a minor setback but that has been easily offset by our very robust aftermarket business as well as our automotive exports. We have multiple balls in the air. Some of them have gone up pretty high. Overall, we are still comfortable as a basket and our growth for the third quarter which has been a fairly muted quarter for Indian automotive. We are very much well on the budget and so we are quite fine with it. Your four-wheeler market share expanded to 35% from 20% five years ago but in the current market, how are you looking to increase the number of clients? Within India, we have a certain space where we work but globally, particularly in the European and North American markets, we have been able to get new traction. In fact, as I had mentioned in the earlier interviews we are setting up a brand new plant exclusively for export of cables for the global OEMs and that includes BMW, Volkswagen, Renault Nissan, Ford, etc, both for the European as well as the US market. The traction that we are getting is in the international business of OEMs that will continue to be strong.

FSSAI to focus on enforcement of food standards in 2019,"New Delhi, Jan 1 () With new food quality standards in place, regulator FSSAI will focus on enforcing the regulations without impacting businesses, CEO Pawan Agarwal said Tuesday.","With new food quality standards in place, regulator FSSAI will focus on enforcing the regulations without impacting businesses, CEO Pawan Agarwal said Tuesday. During 2018, FSSAI accelerated the process of setting standards and notified 27 new regulations for food standards, he added. Some of the key regulations include the ones on alcoholic beverages, food fortification, advertising and claims, packaging, residues of pesticides, tolerance limits of antibiotics and pharmacologically active substances. ""We are setting standards to ensure safe food to consumers and at the same time see to that they do no impact the businesses. Now that the standards (on food products) are more or less in place, our focus is going to be on compliance, monitoring, inspection and enforcement,"" Agarwal told .  A Parliamentary Standing Committee on health and family welfare in a report submitted in 2018 had rapped FSSAI over weak enforcement of food safety laws and also recommended restructuring of the autonomous body that functions under the health ministry.  Asserting that the big focus will be on enforcement, Agarwal said while some of the standards are made effective from January 1, the implementation time for other products has been extended by three or six months depending on the cases.  The new standards effective from January 1 are for all varieties of pulses, whole and decorticated pearl millet grains, de-germed maize flour and maize grit, textured soy protein, sago flour, bee wax and royal jelly. Microbiological standards for fruits and vegetables and their products, all provisions of organic food regulations and standard for honey, except few parameters where test methods are being validated -- are made effective from Tuesday.  According to FSSAI, three-month extension has been given to businesses to comply with the tolerance limit of antibiotics and pharmacology active substances.  Similarly, standards for alcoholic beverages will come into force from April 1, 2019 to coincide with financial year requirements of excise laws.  Food fortification norms will come into force from June 1, compliance of labelling requirement for frozen dessert would be applicable from July 1, FSSAI said.  The regulations on advertising and claims, packaging and labelling requirements of blended edible vegetable oils will come into force from July 1, this year.  In 2018, new standards for fruits and vegetables including canned tomato, jam, jelly and marmalade came into effect from July.

Bangladesh's MPs-elect to take oath on Jan 3; BNP to boycott,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling alliance swept to a landslide victory in the 11th general elections, securing a third straight term.","DHAKA: The newly-elected leaders of the BNP, headed by imprisoned former premier Khaleda Zia, will not take oath as they have rejected the results, the party announced Tuesday, hours after the government said the MPs-elect will be sworn in to Parliament on January 3.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which rejected the poll outcome as ""farcical"" and demanded fresh election, won five seats in the 300-member Parliament.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling alliance swept to a landslide victory in the 11th general elections, securing a third straight term.The opposition alliance, comprising the BNP and some smaller parties, criticised the Election Commission (EC) and accused its chief of being biased.The EC, however, ruled out holding fresh polls.Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu said the newly-elected lawmakers will be sworn in to Parliament on January 3 (Thursday), Dhaka Tribune reported.A gazette notification will be issued on Wednesday, he said.The BNP, alleging irregularities including ballot stuffing and ouster of opposition polling agents from voting centres, said the party's MPs-elect will not take oath as they have already rejected the results, Daily Star reported.The party took the decision in principle at a meeting of its standing committee at its chairperson's Gulshan office, it said.BNP General Secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said: ""We have rejected the polls results. We will also continue our legal battle and action programmes"".Fakhrul, who won from the Bogura-6 constituency, said it has been proved that a credible election is not possible under any partisan government.""The government using state machinery conducted such a farcical election that I think is the most stigmatised election in the country ever,"" he told reporters, alleging that most of the new voters were denied their right to vote.BNP's ally Gonoforum, which has won two seats, said all the opposition candidates will submit a memorandum to the Election Commission on Thursday demanding fresh polls.""Countrymen witnessed and perceived it well how a farcical drama was staged in the name of election on December 30.""Under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the Awami League and its loyal Election Commission have shown the world how to destroy the election system of an independent and sovereign country,"" Gonoforum chief Kamal Hossain said in a statement.He said though the results show the Awami League as the winner, 17 crore people of Bangladesh have lost.""Through it our much expected democracy has been buried,"" Hossain claimed.Fakhrul accused Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) K M Nurul Huda of being the most biased person.""He (Huda) is a partisan person and his activities were questioned.... his view reflects the government's.

Sebi takes aim at 'extremist' speculators with derivative rule,,"   By Ameya Karve and Ashutosh JoshiIndia will make physical settlement of all equity derivatives contracts mandatory this year in a bid to reduce volatility and reinvigorate the process of borrowing and lending of stocks.The Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, had announced its plan to mandate physical settlement in April last year, without giving the timeline. The market regulator said in a statement on Monday that the change in rules will be staggered from April to October depending on the market capitalization of the company.The move may curb excessive speculation in a market where derivatives trading is about 30-times that of the cash market, while adding to short-term volatility around the expiration of contracts, on the last Thursday of every month. The contracts are currently settled in cash, where the seller doesn’t need to deliver the underlying shares. Bloomberg “It is a very good thing to happen for the market,” Purvesh Shelatkar, a senior vice president at Centrum Broking Ltd. in Mumbai. “It will reduce volatility and unwanted extremist speculators.”The volume in the equity derivatives market to the cash segment has increased from 2.9 times in 2009. The ratio is second only to South Korea, Sebi said in a report in 2017.Investors can use the so-called securities lending and borrowing program on major Indian bourses -- BSE Ltd. and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. -- to offer idle shares through clearing houses and earn returns. On the other side, short sellers use this process to borrow stocks.The change in settlement isn’t likely to affect rollover trades, where equity contracts nearing expiry for the month are carried forward to the next month. Traders rolled over an average 71 percent of their futures linked to the NSE Nifty 50 Index -- one of the most traded contracts in the country -- in the past six months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Here are comments from some analysts and fund managers:Venkat Subramanian, Infina Finance“Short term impact will be negative on liquidity and trading volumes of derivatives. Hence there will be a higher impact cost.”Viral Berawala, Essel Finance AMC“This might lead to short-term uncertainty as the market adjusts to new mechanisms for settlement. After the process settles, the stock-specific volatility around expiry would reduce as holders would be positioned much in advance for physical settlement.” “Market participants might start following the global practice of borrowing and shorting which would deepen the share lending and borrowing market.”Deven Choksey, KR Choksey Shares & Securities“Along with delivery-settled trades, volume in share lending and borrowing will also grow and it will help investors in the truest sense to use stock options favorably for hedging.” We hope hyper-trading is supplemented with higher delivery volume in cash markets. This could lead to better depth and liquidity in markets and larger participation in mid-cap stocks.”","Jan 01, 2019, 04:56 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-takes-aim-at-extremist-speculators-with-derivative-rule/articleshow/67335192.cms
Price of oil is going to drive our markets: Pashupati Advani,"
“We have been benefited incredibly because oil has gone from $75 a barrel to under $50.”","If US and China sign a deal, then it is probably not as good for us as we would like it to be, Pashupati Advani  , pashupatiadvani@globalforay, tells ET Now.     Edited excerpts: Just like us you have also been dragged into the studios on the 1st day of 2019.We are one of the two countries in the world where the markets are open on January 1st. I think it is going to be a dull year till we get some kind of direction as to what is happening with the elections and I do not see that happening till about March. We will go up, we will go down, we will just float. There will obviously be stock specific movement in certain industries as they benefit but given that there is going to be some policy making, the bottom line is you have to see which stocks are going to benefit from any kind of policy that is going to come in between now and February. You do not think the US-China trade deal can fire up markets?

View Stock Analysis »It could but then I think we get shut out. If US and China sign a deal, then it is probably not as good for us as we would like. I do not believe that they are going to sign a deal in a hurry. The pressure will now start from the Chinese side, given that the US has got one hand tied behind its back with the government shutdown.  This is the time when the Chinese will strike. They have been playing by lifting soya beans but it is only a big short-term game and I do not know how China is going to be able to react.  You are saying that it is going to be an edgy start to 2019 but what about the decoupling that we have seen at least in the last six months from the US markets? We have been unmoved by what is happening across the globe. But, how long will that last? What if we now begin to fall in line with the rest of the globe? Would that be a possibility? You know the thing about us that makes us slightly different is that we are very much dependent on the oil price and this time when all the trauma is going on worldwide, we have been benefited incredibly because oil has gone from $75 a barrel to under $50. That has been a real selling point. Half the GST revenues are oil driven; half our imports is oil. Therefore this is very much a part of our life and we do not realise it, we talk about the price of gold but it is actually the price of oil that is going to drive our markets, according to me.  We need to see if oil remains at this level which it looks like because of lowering of asset values. In that case, which are the companies that are going to benefit? Obviously things like logistics and transportation will benefit because they have got lower input costs. They are the ones to look at and that is where the opportunities are going to lie.What is your big bet for 2019?One has to be thematic. It is going to be a function of betting on trends. Oil prices could remain subdued. Iran oil is kind of going off balance sheet because China is buying directly and that is taking care of one pocket. But when you look at things like that, whether it is the logistics benefit, in theory autos benefit because people will be able to buy autos, the cost of running a car or a bike is going to be cheaper. Those are the things that one should look at and those are the industries that are going to benefit and then of course, peripherals like ancillaries and services around them those are the kind of companies that we should be looking at. Axis Bank has a new CEO who takes over today, we have already seen a run up in the stock in anticipation. Is there an opportunity again in Axis and ICICI? My experience of new CEOs is that the first three to six months is house cleaning period. A lot of the truth will come out. It may actually wait till April because of the financial year. It depends on how much it is. If it is a small amount, we will see it between now and March, if it is a large amount we will see it in April. But people feel that the most of it is going to over with Axis and the other thing that is very interesting is that as money gets released in the system it is going to be come to banks like Axis so if they are in a position with technology to be able to make sensible loans and the new loans will work I think that that is one of the things to be looked at. There is a lot more in the banking system than has come out and even though there is a lot of optimism flowing, I am not as optimistic as the general market in that space. Would that make you a little circumspect about corporate banks and the kind of recovery that we have seen in the last three months namely in ICICI Bank and Axis? Yes, because after the IL&FS crisis hit, we saw that they were all involved to some extent. But how many other companies are there that are struggling? The real challenge is that a lot of banks in PCA are midcap companies which are finding it difficult to get more working capital to grow and unless we kick-start that whole thing and open the floodgates it is not going to happen.  RBI is doing some opening but they have not opened the floodgates totally, they are letting water through but they are still on a 10% water cut or a 20% water cut, we are not on full steam yet. But the other thing is that we are seeing capex starting so that is a good thing because people who are running good businesses are actually spending on capex and that is a great indicator of companies that feel they are doing well. So if you look at the capex spending, those companies should be looked at. They will have a dull one or two years while they put their new stuff together but then after that they will pick up and move to a new orbit.What about autos?The general trend worldwide is that autos are not going to move up. In India, Maruti has been totally counter cyclical to that because they seem to be selling. We are also at the point where a lot of people are migrating from two-wheelers to four-wheelers. So it is a differentiator for us. We have cars that start at Rs 2 lakh and go up to a couple of crores, or maybe even Rs 10 crore if you buy a Bugati, but most of the cars are available for between Rs 2-7 lakh. That is where the markets are and Maruti seems to be filling that gap really well and plugging away every Rs 50,000 as a new model and its variants. But although there has been a bit of a slowdown, just looking at the last three months data and last December sales which have just come in, is way off the mark? But you know what has happened. This is the problem with the NBFCs. They do not have money to lend and the people who are aspirational and buying autos want to buy it on EMIs and if the NBFCs are having to cut back on their funding or be strict about who they are going to give loans to, then that is the effect.  We had this before once, I cannot remember exactly when, when there was almost like a zero auto lending and then people just did not buy cars, now whether it is for business or whether it is individuals they just stop buying them because I do not think too many people can go out and write a 10 lakh cheque but they are quite happy to pay Rs 20,000 a month to buy a Rs 10 lakh car.

The 2018-19 budget had estimated annual GST collection at Rs 13.48 lakh crore, which means a monthly target of Rs 1.12 lakh crore.The monthly average GST collection in last fiscal (July 2017 - March 2018) was Rs 89,885 crore.The GST revenue could see some more pressure in the coming months as the GST Council has cut rates on 23 items effective January 1, 2019. With the recent round of rate cut, only 28 items are left in the highest tax slab of 28 per cent.The rate reduction would have an annual revenue implication of Rs 5,500 crore, which means that in the remaining three months of the current fiscal (January-March) the revenue loss would be about Rs 1,375 crore.""It appears that the GST revenues are stabilising. During this year, we have had rates heading south, hence it would be difficult for revenue to head north immediately,"" Deloitte India Partner M S Mani said.PwC National Indirect Tax Leader Pratik Jain said GST collections in the next couple of months would be on similar lines and there could be more enforcement and investigation cases.""The government may want to have a more realistic estimate of GST collection for next year. When the new compliance framework comes in from next fiscal, the collections could improve again as there would be greater control over input credit claimed by businesses,"" Jain said.GST collection stood at Rs 1.03 lakh crore in April, Rs 94,016 crore in May, Rs 95,610 crore in June, Rs 96,483 crore in July, Rs 93,960 crore in August, Rs 94,442 crore in September, Rs 1,00,710 crore in October and Rs 97,637 crore in November.EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said the dip in GST revenue collection as compared to the last two months is a bit discouraging.""This may deter the government from rationalising the tax rate of goods left in the 28 per cent category like cement, auto parts, etc in the short term,” he added.

"Expect to sustain current numbers in medium- to long-term: Jitendra Adhia, Atul Auto","
“As of now, we are still studying the EV market. Numbers would come a little later.”","Our complete product portfolio and other external factors are now supportive, Jitendra Adhia, President Finance      , Atul Auto, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: It has been a solid year for Atul Auto especially in the second half. What according to you is driving this kind of demand? If you look at the journey right from last fiscal’s third quarter onwards, we have constantly tried to deliver good numbers. One major thing is our complete product portfolio and other external factors are now supportive. Put all things together, widened net worth within the domestic market as well as exports and complete product portfolio that helps us deliver such good numbers. November-December sales saw slight compression on a sequential basis. Going forward can we expect 4K to be the new norm? Obviously yes. In fact, we are excited to deliver good numbers going forward as well. However, considering the current trend, we expect to sustain the current numbers in a medium to long term as well.  What amount of new orders did you receive this quarter or last few months? What is the inflow expected by the end of FY19? It would be difficult for giving you exact numbers but I can tell you that the trend will continue. The overseas market product is getting good response in domestic market. We have started spreading. I expect that this can sustain and we will at least maintain the trend. How has the export segment been performing and what has been the volume growth that you have clocked. In the first half, although the numbers are insignificant, the growth was almost 100%. The product is a gasoline three-wheeler which is used in almost 18 countries and we are receiving repeat orders. However, I must say that it may take some more time to deliver a sizable volume. There are almost 33 countries in world which are using these three-wheelers. So, there will be scope for widening network over there as well.What share are you expecting from EVs in your sales by the end of the next fiscal?As of now, we are still studying the EV market. Numbers would come a little later however. We are gearing up for delivering a good quality product which we have started. That is the e-rickshaw from Atul Auto Ltd and going forward the technical team is going to prepare another product in the segment of e-auto and likely that will be introduced in the next year or by this calendar year end.What can be seen as a trend going forward? The auto industry has been grappling with a sale slowdown. How soon do you think the industry can leave this dark cloud behind?I would like to limit myself to three-wheeler industry where I clearly see this micro commercial vehicle continuing to grow in domestic as well as overseas market. About the NBFC crisis, although auto financing was not as troubled as the real estate sector, there was definitely some kind of pressure on releasing disbursement from finance companies. But that is over now and we expect that there will be a flow and better liquidity in auto financing as well in the last quarter of this year.

Reducing palm oil duty a death knell for India's refining industry: Solvent Extractors' Association of India,"The Centre, in a notification last night, reduced the duty difference between CPO and palmolien from 10% to 5% on palmolien to be imported from Malaysia. ","The government's decision to reduce the duty difference between CPO (crude palm oil) and palmolien has the potential of sounding the death knell of the palm refining industry, a release issued by the Solvent Extractors' Association of India (SEA) on Tuesday said.The notification issued late at night on 31 st December has reduced the duty difference between CPO and palmolien from 10% to 5% on palmolien to be imported from Malaysia. However,this concession is not available to palmolien coming from Indonesia or any other ASEAN nation. This will result in a piquant position as the same oil will attract different duties from different origins. Admittedly, government has been compelled to honour old agreements of 2010 with Malaysia and ASEAN Countries to reduce the import duty on palm oil with effect from January 1, 2019, the release added. Notification No. 84/2018 of December 31 provides deeper tariff concession in respect of CPO & RBD palmolein imported from Malaysia under India-Malaysia comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement (IMCECA) with effect from January 1, 2019.Similarly notification No.82/2018 of 31st December provide deeper tariff concessions in respect of CPO & RBD Palmolein imported from ASEAN countries under the India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement with effect from January 1, 2019. The over all effective duty reduction is 4.4% for CPO, but in case of RBO Palmolein imported from Malaysia would be 9.9% while from Indonesia would be 4.4%. The duty reduction has reduced the effective duty difference between CPO & RBO Palmolein to just 5.5% against previous 11% as under""This decision of the government is contrary to the “Make in India” efforts of our Prime Minister and would also seriously stymie the efforts at improving palm cultivation in our Country. Needless to say this will also harm the interests of the oilseed farmer who was lately getting enthused with relatively high import duties.

View Stock Analysis »A large part of the stocks gave negative returns and compared to that, 2019 will be a much better year both in terms of the wider scale participation of stocks in the market as also the select stocks which will be larger in number as compared to last year and will give any portfolio a good 15-20% return potential despite the volatility which we expect to continue this year. The outlook for 2019 is much better than that of 2018. As we go into 2019, where would you hunt within the mid and smallcaps? The first target within the mid and smallcaps when market has corrected so much and since volatility is also going to be part of the game next year, will continue to remain within absolute quality. Within absolute quality, the three sectors one should keep in mind are a) domestic consumption; b) selective stories in capital goods and engineering; and c) banking and financials. But that is mostly largecap. But there are certain pockets within the mid and smallcap also which one can look at from the perspective of banking and financials. But largely these are the three sectors and within that quality and reasonable liquidity has to be looked for. Quality is a must and that combination has the potential to give very good returns. When we cover this kind of a midcap, smallcap universe as an organisation or as a PL, we know where to look at but not most of the stocks can be under our coverage. The coverage universe is still a little limited as compared to the opportunities when sectors within the coverage or the emphasis that we want to give are changing. As a combination of covered and uncovered, we have a basket of stocks which we think should give very good returns. You were pretty upbeat in terms of banking stocks. Do you still like ICICI Bank?Absolutely. Corporate banks and within that, ICICI Bank is one of my top picks for 2019 because I feel their capital adequacy is really very good and now since they have mostly declared their extremely large sensitive assets. So that is the first reason.  Apart from that, their lending and advances will also grow and most importantly, the space which will be vacated by NBFCs, to some extent, will go to this bank. Plus, ICICI has very valuable subsidiaries and net of subsidiaries, it is still available at about 1.3 2020 price to book. This is very attractive and gradually over the next two to three years, they will continuously keep doing very well. But even this year, ICICI Bank should give very good returns.  What about NBFCs? Incremental growth is seen coming off. Will that remain the NBFC story in the year ahead? A bit of the NBFC growth is bound to taper down except for a couple of names. Those names are Bajaj Finance, Mahindra Finance or L&T Finance which are very large and reputed corporate houses.  Apart from that, credit growth will sober down for most. But the prices have corrected so much that it will probably reflect the kind of slowdown in credit growth of additional book value and most of these larger NBFCs had created a niche segment for themselves which is not directly in competition with banks. So, their NIMs would be slightly better. They will have a space for themselves to operate. A large part of pain of NBFCs is behind us. At the same time, I do feel that NBFC is not going to be the sector of the year for 2019 as it was for 2016 and 2017 etc. However, select NBFCs can still give very good returns. IT has done fairly well for the year gone by. What does this year bring for IT? There are two ways to look at the market in 2019. In my view, 2019 will have two, three distinct trends as compared to 2018. 2018 was a year of developed markets and emerging markets were at the receiving end as also their currencies and stock prices.  In 2019, it will be a year of emerging markets and we will positive FII flows and that will help the currency and overall the business sentiment also will continue to be good. With this theory, I feel IT is a defensive but there is a segment in the market which feels volatility till elections will be very high and they think IT would be a good place to hide because of very competitive valuations and the nature of free cash generation. But I will underweight on IT for 2019.","Jan 01, 2019, 08:30 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/outlook-for-2019-is-much-better-than-that-of-2018-amisha-vora-prabhudas-lilladher/articleshow/67335879.cms
Centre approves renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj,"The central government has given its consent for renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj about 10 days ago, a home ministry official said. ","A fortnight ahead of the 'Kumbh Mela', the Centre has approved the renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj as sought by the Uttar Pradesh government, officials said Tuesday. The decision came more than two months after the state government, headed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, took the decision to rename the historic city as Prayagraj. The central government has given its consent for renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj about 10 days ago, a home ministry official said.  The 'Kumbh Mela' in Prayagraj will start on January 15 on 'Makar Sankranti' and will conclude on March 4 on 'Maha Shivaratri'.  The central government has given consent to the renaming of at least 25 towns and villages across the country in the past one year. The renaming proposal of UP's Faizabad district as Ayodhya is yet to be received from the state government. A proposal to rename West Bengal as 'Bangla' is pending as the Ministry of External Affairs is understood to have expressed its reservation over the new name, as it sounds similar to Bangladesh. A decision in this regard is expected soon as the general election in the neighbouring country concluded on Sunday.  The Union Home Ministry considers the proposals of name change according to the existing guidelines in consultations with agencies concerned.  It gives its approval to the change of name of any place after taking no-objections from the Ministry of Railways, Department of Posts and Survey of India. These organisations have to confirm that there is no such city, town or village in their records with a name similar to the proposed one.  For changing the name of a village or town or a city, an executive order is needed. The renaming of a state requires amendment of the Constitution with a simple majority in Parliament.","Jan 01, 2019, 04:57 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/centre-approves-renaming-of-allahabad-as-prayagraj/articleshow/67335933.cms

In finding allies Rahul Gandhi has big shoes to fill - his mother's,"The biggest challenge before Gandhi in 2019 would be to cobble up a united Opposition. Here, he has a very big shoes to fill – that of his mother’s. ","If 2018 was the year of that pyaar-bhari-jhappi and the infamous wink afterwards, 2019 would be the year of reckoning for Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Upbeat after a clutch of victories – including the tightly fought Assembly elections in the Hindi heartland – Gandhi would not only have to build the party organisation but also capitalise on the electoral gains ahead of Lok Sabha elections this year. The young Congress president has clinched the semis , but the final - his first big test since taking over the reins from his mother, Sonia - is just a few months away. His party expects him to lead from the front, as familiar phrases like "" still finding his feet” or “learning on the job” may no longer wash . 2019 would be all about delivering decisive results.  Over the last couple of years, Congress has done a course correction in its political strategy. Earlier, its internal surveys had shown that attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi (or even his tenure as chief minister of Gujarat) did not go down well with the people. The surveys conducted by Congress had shown that people listened more if policies were criticised. Congress had then taken to giving data-based critique of BJP government’s policies. Another reason for the change of plan was that the earlier one brought a direct comparison between Modi and Gandhi. This does not mean that he wasted an opportunity to take on the powerful prime minister. His ""suit-boot sarkar"" and “desh ka chowkidaar” comments earned him a lot of connect with the masses. But all these stopped well short of positioning him as a viable “option” against Modi. The biggest challenge before Gandhi in 2019 would be to cobble up a united Opposition. Here, he has a very big shoes to fill – that of his mother’s. Sonia Gandhi has always been a naturally acceptable leader of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance. She has had a personal rapport with leaders cutting across party lines – be it the Left Front or Mamata Banerjee or Mayawati or the politically shrewd Sharad Pawar or Lalu Prasad. It is a well-known fact in political circles that Sonia personally knew the favourite cuisines of other leaders and even minor details of their sartorial choices. She would drive down to the homes of political adversaries, or cross the floor in Parliament to hold a Sushma Swaraj’s hands on a good speech in the House. Gandhi, however, doesn't have that touch even with younger leaders like Akhilesh Yadav. If Sonia was the pivot of UPA regimes, Rahul is a lone spoke in the Opposition’s wheel. More than him, regional satraps like Mamata Banerjee and Chandrababu Naidu have emerged as better unifying forces. Gandhi would need to outdo himself in personal relations. The general elections are the big test, but Gandhi cannot ignore the state elections this year. Six states – Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim – will vote for new state assemblies. Congress is eyeing big gains at least in Haryana, where it has been a formidable political player. But then again, Congress would need to look at more alliances to form a few governments. 2019 would be a year of all work and more work for Gandhi.","Jan 01, 2019, 05:16 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/in-finding-allies-rahul-gandhi-has-big-shoes-to-fill-his-mothers/articleshow/67336051.cms

"Note ban was not a Jhatka, we warned people, says Narendra Modi: Key highlights from his interview",,"From demonetisation, Ram Temple to former RBI governor Urjit Patel's exit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today cleared the air on several issues in his first interview in 2019. Prime Minister said note ban was not a sudden decision. It was necessary to clean the system. Talking about Urjit Patel's exit, Modi said he had himself requested to quit sometime ago citing personal reason. In an interview to ANI, he also said that an Ordinance on Ram temple can be considered only after the judicial process in the Supreme Court is over. Prime Minister also alleged that the Congress slowed down the judicial process by creating ""obstacles"" in the Supreme Court. Here are snippets from the Prime Minister's interview to ANI:*On Rafale deal: I have spoken on the issue in Parliament and in various public meetings. Supreme Court has given their views and the French President has also spoken. Congress has weakened the armed forces. For them, my crime is I am working on Make in India for being self sufficient in defence. My crime is that I am focusing on whatever defence forces need. I do not care about their abuses, I will do my work and strengthen the armed forces. I am working with honesty. Allegation are not personal against me. Congress weakening Indian security forces by making false Rafale claims: PM ModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the Congress is trying to throw muck on him even though the party has nothing to prove him wrong. In an exclusive interview to ANI, Prime Minister Modi said that those levelling allegations on him are actually weakening the Indian security forces. He added that in spite of allegations from the Congress in the Rafale deal, he will continue to expedite the procurement process in defence so that country’s security is not compromised. *On Demonetisation: It was not a sudden decision. Note ban was necessary to clean the system. It wasn’t a jhatka. We had warned people a year before, that if you have such wealth (black money), you can deposit it, pay penalties and you will be helped out. However, they thought Modi too would behave like others so very few came forward voluntarily.* On Opposition's charges of weakening institutions: For ten long years, the PMO was weakened and a NAC was formed. This was disrespecting institutions. In which set up does a party leader have the right to simply tear away a decision taken by the Cabinet. We have to respect institutions.One of our former Prime Ministers called the Planning Commission members a 'bunch of jokers.' Do you know who was the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission then. (Referring to what Mr. Rajiv Gandhi said when Dr. Manmohan Singh was the Deputy Chairman)* On Opposition's Mahagathbandhan: All who looted India are coming together. It is going to be 'Janta' versus 'gathbandhan' in 2019 elections. Modi is just a manifestation of public love and blessings. The people of India are seeing how leaders who want to loot are closing ranks and forming alliances.In 2019, the people of India will set the agenda. They know who is with their aspirations and who is not.* On farm loan waiver: These are political stunts. It doesn't help. If waiving loans can solve the farmer's problem, than it should be done, but history has shown that waivers don't help farmers. When governments make such announcements (of loan waivers), those farmers (who take loans from money lenders) do not become beneficiaries of the waivers. The farmers who are dying are out of the purview of such schemes. There is a small segment of farmers who take loans from banks. A majority of them take loans from money lenders. When governments make such announcements, those farmers do not become beneficiaries of waivers. I want a situation where a farmer never has to be debt-ridden in the first place. For me, farmer welfare is not about politics.Congress' false promise like farm loan waiver is a lollipop. To say a lie and mislead, that is what I called lollipop. Like saying 'we have waived all farm loans'. The truth is that nothing like that has happened. Please see their own circulars, they should not mislead.Congress' loan waivers 'political stunts', do not benefit majority of farmers: PM ModiDubbing the loan waivers announced by the Congress governments as ""political stunts"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday asserted that a majority of farmers do not benefit from these ""misleading"" announcements as only a few of them take loans from banks. In an interview to ANI, he said the solution to the farmers ' problems is to empower them and his government is committed to this. * On Surgical Strike: It was unfortunate that some parties raised doubts about the strike. there are some political parties who began to speak the same language as Pakistan. They politicised the issue. Uri attack rattled me. I gave clear orders that whether you (soldiers) get success or failure, don't think about that but come back before sunrise. I knew it was a big risk. I never care about any political risk to me. The biggest consideration for me was the safety of soldiers.I was more concerned about safety of soldiers: PM Modi on surgical strikes""Come back before sunrise, irrespective of the success or failure of the mission"". This was the message of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Indian Army Special Forces' commandos who went across the Line of Control (LoC) on September 28, 2016 to carry out surgical strikes at terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.  * On Foreign visits: All my foreign trips are at the minimum cost. I visit foreign nation in the interest of the nation. All PMs have had many foreign visits in the past. * On Sabrimala issue: Every Temple has their own beliefs. There are temples where men are not allowed. We should read minutely what the Respected Lady Judge said on the Sabarimala case:* Mob lynching: I condemn mob lynching. No instance of violence is acceptable to us. Even one incident is condemnable:What has happened in West Bengal. A political party (the BJP) is being denied a basic democratic right. Our workers are brutally killed in West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka. Politics of violence has to end. All parties have to reaffirm their commitment to peaceful politics* Sops for Middle class: For middle class, we'll have to change our thinking. Middle class never lives on someone’s mercy. They live with dignity and make immense contribution towards running the country.Inflation is at a low. More educational institutions like IITs and IIMs are being set up. There is a scheme for quality and affordable healthcare. Flying has become affordable and due to that more people are sitting in planes. Who is this benefiting? The middle class*Rahul Gandhi calling GST 'Gabbar Singh Tax': The way someone thinks is the way someone talks. Have GST processes not been done taking a consensus with all political parties in the country? Since Pranab Mukherjee was FM, the GST process has been going on.I accept that small traders were hit due to introduction of GST. * On economic offenders: Fugitives escaped because of weak laws. Government is using all measures to bring back them. They will be brought back, today or tomorrow. Those who have stolen India’s money will have to compensate for each and every penny.* On Congress-mukt bharat: Even Congress people say Congress is a thought, a culture. When I say Congress-mukt, I want to rid the country from this culture and thinking. I say that Congress too needs to be mukt of this culture.*On Modi Wave: I would like to thank the Opposition to recognise that there was a Modi wave. Only thing that matters in democracy is the people wave.* BJP's defeat in state polls: Nobody gave BJP any chance in Telangana and Mizoram. But in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, there was a hung assembly. Secondly, 15 years of anti-incumbency was being fought by our people. Win or loss are not the standard to judge the government. * Urjit Patel wanted to resign 6 months ago: He himself requested (to resign) on personal reasons. I am revealing for the first time, he was telling me about it for past 6-7 months before his resignation. He gave it even in writing. No question of political pressure. He did a good job as RBI Governor.* Attacking Gandhi Family: It is a fact that those considered first family, who ran the country for four generations, are out on bail,that too for financial irregularities. It is a big thing. A set of people, who are at their service, are trying to suppress such information and push other narratives.* On Pakistan:Pakistan will never improve on the basis of one war. That nation will still take some time to improve. All PMs of India, across all parties never opposed dialogue with Pakistan. But, can we hear anything in the midst of bombs? Today, terror supporting Pakistan is isolated:*Ordinance on Ram temple after legal process is over: ""Let the judicial process be over. After the judicial process is over, whatever will be our responsibility as the government, we are ready to make all efforts,"" Modi said. The Ram Temple Issue issue is in the BJP manifesto and the party will try to find the solution under the ambit of the Constitution.I want to appeal to the Congress not to use their lawyers to delay the judicial process on the Ram Temple.* Ayushmaan Bharat: In just 100 days, nearly 6 lakh people have been benefited from the scheme.(Inputs from ANI) Congress lawyers should stop creating obstacles in Ram Mandir case: PM ModiWhile speaking to ANI in an exclusive interview Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in detail about Ram Temple. PM Modi said, “Triple Talaq ordinance was brought after Supreme Court (SC) verdict. We have said in our manifesto that a solution will be found to solve this issue under the Constitution of India.

PM Narendra Modi makes it clear that Ordinance on Ram Temple can be considered only after legal process gets over,"In an interview to ANI, he also suggested that the judicial process was being slowed down because Congress lawyers were creating “obstacles” in the Supreme Court.","NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruled out an ordinance ordering the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya before the Supreme Court decides the matter, saying in an interview to ANI that the Bharatiya Janata Party is committed to a solution under the Constitution. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had earlier demanded that the government issue an ordinance to build the temple at the earliest.“We have said in our manifesto that a solution would be found to this issue under the ambit of the Constitution. After the judicial process is over, whatever will be our responsibility as the government, we are ready to make all efforts,” Modi said. He also told Congress to stop its lawyers from obstructing the judicial process. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the Ayodhya matter on January 4.Apart from the temple issue, Modi also spoke on Urjit Patel’s resignation as RBI governor, farm loan waivers, demonetisation, GST, the Rafale deal and other matters in a 90-minute interview that reflected BJP’s likely campaign points ahead of the general election later this year.“The ordinance in the triple talaq matter was brought after the Supreme Court judgement and in light of the judgement, not before it,” the prime minister said, when asked why the party was not issuing an ordinance on the Ram temple issue as it had for triple talaq.He said Patel resigned as RBI governor in December for personal reasons. Patel had expressed his desire to quit six-seven months before he eventually did and had even written to the PM about this. Modi dismissed the Congress accusation that Patel had been forced to step down because of a dispute with the government over RBI’s autonomy. “No such question arises. I acknowledge that Patel did a good job as RBI governor,” Modi said.Modi dismissed farm loan waivers by Congress-ruled states as “political stunts”, saying they invariably get linked with polls and a majority of farmers do not benefit from them as many actually take loans from money lenders, not banks, and that they are the ones who are dying.“The Congress-led UPA also announced a farm loan waiver in 2009 to win the election,” Modi said. He said structural changes were needed so that farmers didn’t get into a debt trap in the first place. “It is our government that took the historic decision on better minimum support price for farmers so that the farmer does not have to rely on debt.”The prime minister said the GST regime was being continually refined to safeguard consumers and that the rates of nearly 1,200 items of daily use had been lowered to the18%,12% and 5% slabs and, in some cases, to zero. “Before GST, the tax rates in the country were as high as 30-40% with some hidden taxes,” the PM said. His government also wanted the tax liability slab to be raised from ?20 lakh to ?75 lakh for relief to traders but could not do so at the last GST Council meeting due to the reservations of some states and the matter has been referred to a committee.“We also want to bring material used for under-construction houses in the 5% slab,” Modi said. He stressed that all decisions were taken by consensus in the GST Council, which had representation from all states, including Congress-ruled ones. “So, are they (Congress) abusing their own party leaders and their governments? Just creating a political hue and cry is not good,” the PM said. Congress president Rahul Gandhi had previously referred to GST as ‘Gabbar Singh Tax’. The prime minister also defended demonetisation, saying it was not a “jhatka” (shock) but a step taken after repeated warnings given by him for almost a year that people with black money should declare it and pay the penalty.“Still, many did not do it. They thought Modi too would behave like others and did not come forward. Demonetisation led to the cleansing of the system and bringing in an honest culture,” he said. Modi also countered the allegations made by Gandhi on the Rafale issue, saying that Congress was trying to sully his reputation even though it had no evidence, accusing it of undermining the nation’s armed forces in the process.“The SC has cleared the matter. If there are any allegations against me personally, let them (Congress) dig who gave what, when and where and to whom,” he said. “Those levelling such allegations are actually weakening the Indian security forces. Should I worry that they are making personal attacks on me, or whether my country’s needs should be met? I will expedite procurement processes, whatever abuses and allegations are hurled at me.” The PM also asked why defence deals cannot be done without middlemen. Tweeting from RSS’ official handle, Sangh leader Dattatreya Hosabale said: “We feel the statement by PM is a positive step in the direction of temple construction.”","Jan 02, 2019, 06:21 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/ordinance-on-ram-temple-only-after-legal-process-gets-over-pm-modi/articleshow/67337091.cms
"Stung by critical article, Railway ministry seeks action against MoS PMO's aide",Sanjiv Kumar has been vocal in raising concerns related to the alleged wrong functioning of some wings of the Railway ministry.,"NEW DELHI: The Railway ministry has decided to take disciplinary action against Union minister Jitendra Singh's OSD for casting aspersions against its minister Piyush Goyal and questioning the wisdom of senior government officials in an article, according to official documents.  Railway Board Secretary Ranjanesh Sahai has written to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) asking for the immediate repatriation of Sanjiv Kumar, a 2005 batch officer of the Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS) for ""breach of official decorum and misconduct"".  Kumar is the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to Jitendra Singh, who holds multiple portfolios, including minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office and for Development of North Eastern Region.  ""A case of breach of official decorum and misconduct of Sanjiv Kumar, IRPS, has been brought to the notice of railway board. Sanjiv Kumar has authored an article, published by www.railsamachar.com and www.nationalwheels.com,"" Sahai wrote in his letter to the DoPT.  The article, besides being in bad taste, questions the wisdom of senior functionaries of the level of secretary to the government of India and also casts aspersions on the Minister of Railways (Piyush Goyal), it said.  ""...it is proposed to take up the officer under the Railway Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968. You would appreciate that a misconduct of this nature and that too in the public domain would send a wrong message all around and encourage indiscipline in the service,"" the letter dated December 28, 2018, said.  Sahai asked DoPT Secretary C Chandramouli ""to consider immediate repatriation of Sanjiv Kumar, IRPS, to this ministry for taking action as deemed appropriate"". It added that the issue had the approval of the Railway Board chairman.  Ashwani Lohani retired as Railway Board chairman on Monday.  Kumar has been vocal in raising concerns related to the alleged wrong functioning of some wings of the Railway ministry.  ""The article written by Kumar clearly mentions that all is not good in the Railway ministry. It needs immediate intervention of the Prime Minister's Office,"" said an officer requesting anonymity.  The Railway ministry has internally transferred another officer for allegedly raising concerns on cadre related issues.  Chetan Prakash Jain, a 1994 batch IRPS officer, executive director, Establishment (GC) has been appointed executive director, Establishment (G), which officials say is a less significant charge.  Anand Singh Khati has been appointed in his post, officials said, citing an order.  On December 14, Jain, along with some other officials, presented a memorandum to Singh, who is also minister of state for Personnel, saying the Railway Board has not agreed with the recommendation of Cadre Review Committee (CRC) for keeping the post of 'member staff' exclusively for IRPS officers.  IRPS officers and senior Railway Board functionaries were at loggerheads after the letter, officials said.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:11 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/stung-by-critical-article-railway-ministry-seeks-action-against-mos-pmos-aide/articleshow/67337394.cms

Companies failing to comply with Aadhaar Act norms may be liable for up to Rs 1 crore fine,"The Aadhaar Act, at present, does not empower the body to take enforcement action against errant entities in the Aadhaar ecosystem.","NEW DELHI: The government has proposed a penalty of up to Rs 1 crore on entities that violate the provisions of the Aadhaar Act, with an additional fine of up to Rs 10 lakh per day in case of continuous non-compliance, sources said. Amid privacy concerns over Aadhaar, amendments have been planned in the Act, under which the government also proposes to arm the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) with more powers, similar to that of regulators, sources said. The Aadhaar Act, at present, does not empower the body to take enforcement action against errant entities in the Aadhaar ecosystem. Children, holding Aadhaar, will have the option of cancellation of the 12 digit biometric identifier within a period of six months of attaining 18 years of age. The consent of a parent or guardian will be must for enrolling a child, while no child will be denied any subsidy, benefits or services for lack of Aadhaar, as per the proposed changes. The proposed amendments also make provision for 'Virtual ID' and voluntary and offline modes of using Aadhaar. A bill to amend the Aadhaar Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. Besides, the government also plans to set up a UIDAI fund under the Aadhaar Act and has proposed that the authority be exempt from taxes on income. Mooting fines for violation of the Aadhaar Act, the draft provisions say that a new section will be added to provide for civil penalties which may extend to Rs 1 crore for each contravention on failure to comply with provisions of the Act, rules, regulations and directions by any entity in the Aadhaar ecosystem. The Aadhaar ecosystem includes enrolling agencies, registrars, requesting entities, offline verification seeking entities and any other entity or group as may be specified by regulations. It further mooted an additional penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh for each day of continuing non-compliance after the first contravention. Punishment for unauthorised access to the Central Identities Data Repository as well as data tampering is proposed to be extended to 10 years each from the current three years. According to sources, the government is keen to give UIDAI regulatory powers, considering the fact that over 122 crore Aadhaar numbers have been issued across the country but the authority does not currently have powers to take enforcement actions against errant entities. There will be a provision to file appeal before the TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal), and against the orders of TDSAT an appeal can be made in the Supreme Court. The government also plans to amend the Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to provide for voluntary use of Aadhaar for obtaining SIMs and opening bank accounts. The Supreme Court, in a landmark verdict in September last year, had upheld the constitutional validity of 'Aadhaar' but limited the scope of the controversial biometric identity project, ruling it is not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions. Holding there was nothing in the Aadhaar Act that violates right to privacy of an individual, the SC had cleared the use of Aadhaar (world's largest biometric ID programme) for welfare schemes. The court had held that Aadhaar will remain mandatory for filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN) but struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporate to avail of the biometric Aadhaar data. Following this, the Cabinet last month approved amendments to Aadhaar Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.","Jan 01, 2019, 07:30 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/companies-failing-to-comply-with-aadhaar-act-norms-may-be-liable-for-up-to-rs-1-crore-fine/articleshow/67337607.cms
"Trade setup: Nifty50 needs to move past 100-DMA at 10,904 level","Tuesday’s session is likely to see the levels of 10,965 and 11,035 acting as resistance area."," It was an action-packed start to New Year as the NSE benchmark Nifty rebounded over 120 points from the day’s to end with a modest gain on Tuesday. The market opened lower and traded sideways for most part of the session, showing no attempts for a recovery. However, the last hour saw the index surging sharply with the benchmark ending with a gain of 47.55 points or 0.44 per cent. Despite the rise, the Nifty has halted once again at its 100-DMA, which is presently at 10,904. This level, theoretically speaking, still exist as a potential resistance mark for the market. The Wednesday’s session is likely to see a positive opening to the trade, and we expect the index to extend its upmove, at least in the initial session. With nearly all global markets shut, we have no global cues to look forward to in the morning. Next session is likely to see the levels of 10,965 and 11,035 acting as resistance area. Supports may come in at 10,850 and 10,790 zones. ETMarkets.com The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily charts stood at 57.6162 and it continued to remain neutral against the price. The daily MACD has turned bullish after reporting a positive crossover. It now traded above its signal line. No significant formations were observed on the Candles. Pattern analysis on the daily charts showed that Nifty continued to resist at its 100-DMA and this level remains an important resistance on closing basis. Though it has moved past the falling trend line pattern resistance, but is yet to clear the important resistance zone of 10,900-109,50 area. Overall, despite a sharp surge that was witnessed in the previous session, it is yet to move past the 100-DMA level, which is at 10,904. On technical terms, with the market ending near the high point of the day, expect a positive start and extension of the pullback. However, it will be important for the Nifty to move past the 100-DMA with conviction on closing basis. The F&O data continues to suggest undercurrent remaining buoyant. Positive outlook is advised for the day. (Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA is Consultant Technical Analyst at Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, Vadodara.

"In a first, NCLT allows government to reopen IL&FS books","For the first time, the government on December 21, 2018, had invoked the powers under Section 130 of the new Companies Act of 2013 to reopen the books of a company.","MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal Tuesday allowed the corporate affairs ministry to reopen the books of the crippled IL&FS Group and its subsidiaries for the past five years under Section 130 of the Companies Act, to ascertain financial mismanagement.For the first time, the government on December 21, 2018, had invoked the powers under Section 130 of the new Companies Act of 2013 to reopen the books of a company.The government wants to check the balance-sheets of the crippled group and its two listed subsidiaries--ITNL and IL&FS Financial Services for the past five years (FY13-FY18) and the move comes after the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and ICAI reports indicated that the accounts were prepared a fraudulently and negligently in the last five years by the previous management.The statutory bodies including, the the Reserve Bank, the markets watchdog Sebi and the Income Tax Department gave their no objection for restating the accounts.However, the auditors Ernst & Young owned SRBC & Co, Delloitte Haskins & Sells and KPMG affiliate BSR Associates opposed the move citing that they had no role in the alleged frauds.The financial accounts are made by the company and not the auditors, they argued.To this, the government informed the tribunal that the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) had sent a show cause notice in relation to the alleged frauds to the IL&FS to the auditors.The auditors argued that the ICAI probe is at a nascent stage and cannot be the basis of recasting of financial accounts.Hearing the petition, the two-member NCLT bench of judges VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy observed that based on the ICAI and SFIO reports though it cannot be concluded that the auditors and former directors had any role in preparing of the financial accounts, lets reopen it in the interest of fairness. After allowing the reopening and recasting the books of account of IL&FS, ITNL and IL&FS Financial Services, the tribunal clarified that the order is without any prejudice and will not affect the proceedings before ICAI and SFIO probe.The government also wants NCLT to appoint an independent chartered accountant to restate the accounts and revise the balance-sheets and wants three months to do the job. The group owes over Rs 94,000 crore to lenders, mostly banks.It can be noted that this is the first instance of the government invoking Section 130 of the Companies Act, which empowers it reopen accounts only on a court/tribunal' order.The law states that ""a company shall not re-open its books of account and not recast its financial statements, unless an application is made by the Central government, income-tax authorities, Sebi, any other statutory regulatory body or authority or any person concerned and an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or the tribunal to the effect that i) the relevant earlier accounts were prepared in a fraudulent manner; or (ii) the affairs of the company were mismanaged during the relevant period, casting a doubt on the reliability of financial statements.""","Jan 01, 2019, 08:53 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/in-a-first-nclt-allows-government-to-reopen-ilfs-books/articleshow/67338447.cms
New year bonanza: RBI issues norms for restructuring loans to MSMEs,RBI permitted a one-time restructuring of existing loans to MSMEs that are in default but 'standard' as on Jan 1.,"In a new year gift to the MSME sector, the Reserve Bank Tuesday allowed a one-time restructuring of existing debt up to Rs 25 crore for the companies which have defaulted on payment but the loans given to them have continued to be classified as standard assets.The decision will help the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) which are facing cash crunch in the wake of demonetisation and GST implementation.The RBI's board in its crucial meeting held on November 19, 2018 had advised the central bank examine a scheme for restructuring of stressed standard assets of MSME borrowers with aggregate credit facilities of up to Rs 25 crore, subject to such conditions as are necessary for ensuring financial stability.To facilitate meaningful restructuring of MSME accounts that have become stressed, the RBI has decided to permit a one-time restructuring of existing loans to MSMEs that are in default but 'standard' as on January 1, 2019, without an asset classification downgrade, the central bank said in a statement.To be eligible for the scheme, the aggregate exposure, including non-fund based facilities of banks and NBFCs, to a borrower should not exceed Rs 25 crore as on January 1, 2019, and the restructuring has to be implemented by March 31, 2020.Restructuring package for MSME was one of the sore points of the tussle between the RBI and the government.There was a detailed presentation by Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar on the cash crunch being faced by the MSME sector at the crucial November 19 board meeting.The government had suggested several steps to help the sector which contributes 50 per cent to the manufacturing sector.""A major step for MSMEs with a total liability up to 25 cr suffering from past issues and illiquidity, though delayed. Congratulations RBI for the restructure circular,"" Swadeshi ideologue and RBI board member S Gurumurthy tweeted.Gurumurthy was pushing for a relief to the MSME sector which provides 12 crore employment, the second largest after the agriculture sector.""MSMEs are vital for India's economic ascension. Several initiatives including customised products and strategies as per their needs and automated loan processing have been introduced to achieve faster turnaround and accelerate MSMEs' growth,"" Kumar had said last year.As per the notification, ""A provision of 5 per cent in addition to the provisions already held, shall be made in respect of accounts restructured under this scheme. Each bank/NBFC should formulate a policy for this scheme with board approval which shall, inter alia, include framework for viability assessment of the stressed accounts and regular monitoring of the restructured accounts.""The borrowing entity is GST-registered on the date of implementation of the restructuring. However, this condition will not apply to MSMEs that are exempt from GST-registration, it said.According to the notification, banks and NBFCs adopting this scheme will put in place a board approved policy on restructuring of MSME advances under these instructions within a month from the date of this circular.The policy will include framework for viability assessment of the stressed accounts and regular monitoring of the restructured accounts.""It is clarified that accounts classified as NPA can be restructured; however, the extant asset classification norms governing restructuring of NPAs will continue to apply,"" it said.

"NBFCs still lost deep in the woods, says Uday Kotak","Kotak, who has been tasked to lead efforts to save IL&FS, said the sector is more ""fragile"" than a year ago. ","Veteran banker Uday Kotak Tuesday said even though non-bank lenders have received a breather since the crisis late last year, the sector is more ""fragile"" than it was a year ago. Uday Kotak, who has been tasked to lead the efforts of saving the debt-ridden infra lender IL&FS, said we need to carefully watch the space going forward. ""Hopefully, the NBFC sector which saw significant pressure in October-November last year is beginning to breathe a little better now. However, I do believe that the sector is more fragile than what it was one year ago,"" Kotak said in an annual message to employees at Kotak Mahindra Bank. He attributed the stress in the (NBFC) space to liquidity concerns emanating out of the rise in interest rates as the high growth in financial savings post-demonetisation began to go back as currency in circulation. IL&FS, which has a debt of over Rs 94,000 crore, was the ""first major default"" and led to questions over whether the nation would have a ""Lehman-like mini crisis"", he said. Uday Kotak, the executive vice chairman and managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said he took up the task of heading IL&FS on a request from the government as a ""national duty"". He exuded confidence that the financial sector will weather the current storm with corrective actions like consolidations in bank balance sheets and steps taken at ensuring stability. Kotak said all the businesses he heads are in very good shape fundamentally and very well positioned for growth but expressed disappointment over the bank scrip rising only 20 per cent, exhorting the employees its biggest strengths to ensure for a faster growth in 2019. Going ahead, the challenge for the economy is to accelerate growth to beyond the 7 per cent, he said, adding this is essential given the large population.","Jan 02, 2019, 06:12 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/nbfcs-still-lost-deep-in-the-woods-says-uday-kotak/articleshow/67338653.cms

The deadline to make the filings was initially set at December 15, which the Supreme Court on December 13 extended to the end of the month.According to the standard operating procedure for the claims and objections process, authorities need to issue notices on the applications by January 15 and start the verification process on February 1.","Jan 01, 2019, 09:23 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/nrc-offices-see-flood-of-applications-on-final-day-to-file-claims-and-objections/articleshow/67339059.cms
Govt waives late fee for non-filers of GST returns between July '17-Sept '18,The fee for late filing of the returns is Rs 25 per day for Central GST and an equal amount under State GST,"The government has waived late fees for non-filers of summary and final sales returns for the July 2017-September 2018 period by businesses registered under the goods and services tax (GST). However, these businesses would have to file their returns for the 15-month period by March 31, 2019, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) said.  Giving effect to the decision of the GST Council in its December 22 meeting, CBIC has notified waiver of late fees for non filing of GSTR-3B, GSTR-1 and GSTR-4 and non-payment of taxes between July 2017 and September 2018.  While GSTR-3B is the summary sales return filed by businesses, GSTR-1 is the final sales return. GSTR-4 is filed by businesses who have opted for composition scheme, under which they have to file returns quarterly.  The fee for late filing of the returns is Rs 25 per day for Central GST (CGST) and an equal amount under State GST (SGST).  However, those businesses who have to file returns but have 'nil' tax liability would have to pay a fine of Rs 10 under CGST law, and an equal amount under SGST law.  The CBIC said ""the amount of late fee payable under Section 47 of the said (CGST) Act shall stand waived for the registered persons who failed to furnish the return"" in Form GSTR-3B GSTR-1, for the months between July 2017 and September 2018, by the due date but furnishes the said return between the period from December 22, 2018 to March 31, 2019.  For businesses filing GSTR-4, the late fees would be waived for non-filing of returns for the quarters from July 2017 to September 2018 provided the said returns are furnished between the period from December 22, 2018 to March 31, 2019, the CBIC said.  AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said: ""On popular demand, the finance ministry has finally waived the late fees for taxpayers who were unable to file GSTR-1, GSTR 3B or GSTR-4 for the period July 2017 to September 2018 by the due date but furnished the same between 22 December to 31 March, 2019.

Over 35 lakh women form human wall across Kerala,The event comes days after thousands of devotees lit 'Ayyappa Jyothis' (lighting of sacred lamps) and lined up from Hosangadi in Kasaragod to Kanyakumari,"In a first, over 35 lakh women stood shoulder-to-shoulder across the national highways in Kerala, creating a 620 km-long human 'wall' from the northern end of Kasaragod to the southern tip here Tuesday as part of a state-sponsored initiative to uphold gender equality. The event comes days after thousands of devotees lit 'Ayyappa Jyothis' (lighting of sacred lamps) and lined up from Hosangadi in Kasaragod to Kanyakumari, vowing to protect the age-old customs and traditions of Sabarimala. On Tuesday, women from various walks of life -- writers, athletes, actors, politicians and techies, government officials and homemakers -- stood across the highways crisscrossing through the 14 districts in the state as the event commenced at 4 pm. Expressing solidarity, thousands of men also lined up parallel forming a second human 'wall'. The 'Women's wall' was conceived in the backdrop of frenzied protests witnessed in the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala after the CPI(M)-led LDF government decided to implement the Supreme Court verdict, allowing all women to pray at the Ayyappa shrine. Representatives of Universal Record Forum (URF) which records amazing feats across the globe declared the human wall as the ""longest women's wall in the world"" with participation of over 35 lakh women. However, CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan claimed 55 lakh women lined up for the 'wall'. CPI(M) polit bureau member Brinda Karat, who was the last member of the human wall at Thiruvananthapuram, said women in Kerala have scripted history by erecting a ""human wall of resistance"" against the dark forces. She also lashed out at the saffron party, saying it was using women for its ""toxic, divisive, anti-women political goal"" and asked women not to be the pawns in the hands of those who have no thoughts about the future of women. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, his cabinet colleagues and Communist veteran V S Achuthanandan were among those who were present at the public meeting here after the formation of the wall. Vijayan garlanded the statue of Ayyankali, a social reformer, before the start of the event. The wall has become a movement against gender discrimination faced by women and to protect their Constitutional rights, he said. The initiative also witnessed a group of the Jacobite faction of the Christian community lining up in support of the wall along with members of the Muslim community. Former firebrand communist leader and Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy supremo, 100-year-old K R Gowriamma also took part in the event near her home at Alappuzha. Jhonson V Idikula, chairman of the monitoring panel of the URF Adjudication Committee, told they had over 600 volunteers across the state to monitor the event. ""We have recorded the event, clicked pictures and captured videos to prepare a comprehensive report,"" Idikula said. However, the main Opposition Congress, which all through had expressed their ire against the wall, said ""Kerala society has dismissed the government's much-hyped event."" The BJP state leadership dubbed the wall a ""total failure"" and waste of government funds and machinery. G Sukumaran Nair, heading the Nair Service Society (NSS), which kept away from the event, said 'God's Own Country' will turn into 'Devil's Own Country' after formation of such walls. Violence also marred the initiative as participants of the women's 'wall' at Chettukund in Kasaragod district were attacked, allegedly by some BJP-RSS workers, as they lined up at the National Highway there to form the human chain. The workers hurled stones at the women and policemen, injuring three personnel, police said, adding that they had to fire in the air and burst teargas shells to disperse the attackers. Media personnel of two television channels were also attacked by the activists, who reportedly forced them to delete the visuals of the incident. ccording to K Sreekanth, BJP Kasaragod district president, the violence was allegedly a handiwork of CPI(M) as the 'Women's wall"" was a failure in the northernmost district. CPI(M) district secretary, M V Balakrishnan, slamming the BJP, alleged that BJP workers had burnt grass and shrubs after sprinkling chilly powder and 13 women were hospitalised inhaling the fumes. A group of women in New Delhi Tuesday also expressed solidarity with their counterparts in Kerala by holding a demonstration outside Kerala House at the national capital's Jantar Mantar road where members of National Federation of Indian Women held placards saying, ""Equality and Justice is Women's Constitutional Right"". The 'Women's wall' was suggested at a meeting called by the Kerala government, following massive protests by right-wing parties and a section of devotees over the government's decision to implement the September 28 apex court order, allowing women of all ages to offer prayers at Sabarimala.","Jan 02, 2019, 01:57 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/over-35-lakh-women-form-human-wall-across-kerala/articleshow/67339256.cms

Paul John, chairman and managing director at John Distilleries, holds the remaining 57% stake.Gaja Capital, which invested about 75 crore in John Distilleries in 2011-2013, has made a fivefold return through the exit, said one of the people mentioned above. With sales of more than 15 million cases, John Distilleries is also the manufacturer of the world's seventh-largest whisky brand - Original Choice Whisky, with sales of 11 million cases a year.

Government may sow big scheme to weed out farm distress,Govt is considering changes in the MSP and also a direct income transfer to make up for low income from farms.,"With the general election a few months away, the central government has begun crunching the numbers in preparation for a comprehensive programme to help farmers tide over challenges posed by a dip in prices and dwindling incomes.The government is keen on a more substantive intervention than a loan waiver at the central level to alleviate agrarian distress besides stepping up investments in the sector, having concluded that writing off debt doesn’t help address underlying problems.It is considering further changes in the minimum support price (MSP) regime to make it more effective and also a direct income transfer to make up for low income from farms.“The second option (direct income transfer) entails large numbers,” said a government official, adding that it also needs to be seen how the benefits can be targeted to reach poor farmers who need the support.The Centre announced a tweaked MSP programme in September 2018 but a more liberal scheme under which a farmer can get the difference between prevailing market rates and the support price is also being looked at.Policymakers are more inclined toward a targeted scheme that can immediately provide some relief to farmers as this would also spur the investment cycle in the farm economy.  An income transfer scheme for poor farmers based on the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) that has already mapped household deprivation may be the best answer, according to some in the government.It may also be politically more acceptable after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party recently lost assembly elections in three north Indian states to Congress. That was followed by farm loan waivers announced by Congress-ruled and other states.FISCAL PRESSUREA central scheme focussing on income transfer may put pressure on the government’s finances, forcing it to change the fiscal glide path to meet funding requirements. The fiscal deficit is projected at 3.3% of GDP this year and the medium-term goal is to reach 3% by FY21. The Centre is now looking at all possible scenarios, including sharing costs of such a programme with the states.In a note last month, SBI Research had suggested payments of Rs 12,000 per family per year in two instalments for 216 million small and marginal farmers. The total outgo was seen at Rs 50,000 crore, almost equal to the amount the government spends on the rural employment guarantee scheme.STATE SCHEMESThe income transfer scheme could be on the lines of Telangana’s Rythu Bandhu scheme, which offers ? 4,000 per acre to all land-owning farmers.Jharkhand and Odisha have followed in its footsteps even as debate rages on the best form of assistance to farmers. Odisha has launched the Kalia scheme that will provide ?10,000 to about 3 million small and marginal farmers for the rabi and kharif crops. Jharkhand has announced a ?5,000-per-acre payment to 2.3 m medium and marginal farmers from the next financial year.West Bengal has announced two new schemes for farmers and farm labourers in the state that entail a payment of ?5,000 per acre every year in two instalments besides ?2 lakh to the kin of farmers who die due to any reason, including suicide.PM Narendra Modi described the loan waivers by Congress state governments as “political stunts”, ANI reported on Tuesday. He said in an interview that most farmers don’t benefit from them as only a few take loans from banks and most borrow from money lenders.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:13 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/government-may-sow-big-scheme-to-weed-out-farm-distress/articleshow/67342862.cms
"Samsung India revenue grows, profit falls","While fighting Chinese competitors with lower priced phones, Samsung saw net profit fall by as much as 11%.","Fighting Chinese competitors with lower priced phones saw Samsung India’s net profit fall by as much as 11% but revenues grew by 10% to cross the milestone of Rs 60,000 crore in FY18. While the South Korean giant did not attribute any reason behind the performance in its regulatory filings to the Registrar of Companies (RoC), two senior industry executives said the fall in profitability was due to Samsung India’s focus on launching price-aggressive smartphones at relatively lower margin to combat Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus. Total income touched Rs 61,065.6 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 55,511.9 crore in the previous year, while net profit dipped by 10.7% to Rs 3,712.7 crore, as per its latest filings. The world’s largest handset maker also continued the pace of sales growth seen in its mobile phone business in India growing 9% to touch Rs 37,349 crore, maintaining its revenue lead in the Indian smartphone market. Rival Xiaomi’s sales in FY18 was Rs 22,947 crore, Oppo Mobiles India was Rs 11,994 crore and Vivo Mobile India Rs 11,179 crore. Apple India’s FY18 sales was Rs 13,097 crore. Though the mobile business profit before tax dipped in FY18 to Rs 3,415.9 crore from Rs 4735.6 crore in the fiscal earlier, Samsung continues to be the most profitable consumer electronics and smartphone maker in India.Though competitors Xiaomi, Sony LG and Huawei are profitable, they are far behind whereas Oppo and Vivo are in losses.   Samsung’s television business, however, grew by less than 1% last fiscal at Rs 4,512 crore as compared to Rs 4481 crore in 2016-17. Industry executives attributed this to the intense competition and sales taking a hit in the 32 inches segment – which accounts for almost 50% of total TV market — from the online focussed brands like Vu, BPL, Xiaomi and Thomson. Samsung had decided to focus on the higher margin premium and large screen TV models. An email sent to Samsung India did not elicit any response till Tuesday press time. Last fiscal the company sold its printer business to HP India.Samsung said in the filing that it was not a major line of business. Samsung also commenced a new line of business in India related to semi-conductors and device solutions during the year, without elaborating. In the filings with the Registrar of Companies, Samsung said it is the largest brand in televisions, frostfree and side-by-side refrigerators in India. As per Hong Kong-based tracker Counterpoint Research, Xiaomi became the market leader in the Indian smartphone market for the first time ever in the October-December quarter of 2017. As of period from July to September, Counterpoint estimates that the Chinese company Xiaomi had 27% share followed by Samsung with 23% share.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories","Jan 04, 2019, 08:58 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/samsung-india-revenue-grows-profit-falls/articleshow/67342852.cms
Handsets association unhappy with draft electronics policy,"The draft National Policy on Electronics (NPE), released in October, aims to double India’s mobile phone production from 500 million in 2019 to 1 billion units, valued at $190 billion, by 2025.","New Delhi: A top handsets body has trashed the proposed policy on electronics, calling it inadequate for attracting global giants and arguing for special incentives to help develop India as an electronics manufacturing hub rivalling China and Vietnam.“Companies such as Apple, Samsung, LG, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei and Foxconn will require a special plan and outreach that need to be identified as part of the vision document,” the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) said in a recent letter to IT secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney.“Merely statements of intent will not be enough unless we adopt specific surgical strategies with relentless and quantifiable milestones. Addressing global markets is key to our expansion plans,” said the handsets body, which counts Apple, Foxconn, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, Flex, Wistron and Lenovo among its members.The global electronics industry is dominated by component ecosystems, which drive as much as 80-85% of the industry. The only way to establish India as a global destination is to identify and attract these ecosystems to make the country their home, ICEA said.The body suggested that the government make changes to the draft policy by including its suggestions, which lay a bigger emphasis on exports. Without exports, the association said, it would be difficult to achieve the government’s proposed targets. “A complete change in mindset is required in the political leadership, bureaucracy, industry and trade to focus on exports and not merely import substitution,” the letter said.The draft National Policy on Electronics (NPE), released in October, aims to double India’s mobile phone production from 500 million in 2019 to 1 billion units, valued at $190 billion, by 2025. Of this $190 billion, the government hopes exports will account for $110 billion.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesIn the letter, the ICEA contested the government’s estimate that demand for electronics hardware in India would rise to $400 billion by 2023-24, saying that it would reach only $170 billion by then.“The size of the Indian economy would be approximately $4.5-5 trillion by 2023-24. World over, the electronics industry is usually 3-4% of the total size of the economy. Therefore, the size of electronics consumption in India is expected to grow between $150 billion and $200 billion by 2023-24,” the letter said. The association said the government would need to configure a competitive direct tax regime, such as the ones offered by China and Vietnam. India must not fall into the “Brazilian fault line” by mimicking an economy that had singularly adopted a very high tariff-based intervention mechanism, primarily focusing on manufacturing for the domestic market requirements without any focus on exports, it said. “Sadly, Brazil has failed to achieve any of the policy objectives it had originally set out to achieve. Therefore, NPE must focus on improving manufacturing competitiveness and competencies with special focus to tap export potential.”India has, over the past two years, adopted a phased manufacturing plan to incentivise component assembly gradually, which has so far led to over 250 plants being set up. But the handset industry believes the ultimate aim of the PMP — to make India a global manufacturing hub — will only happen by making the country a base for exports.According to the draft, the government plans to replace the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme with programmes that will be easier to implement, such as interest subsidy and credit default guarantees.","Jan 02, 2019, 07:04 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/handsets-association-unhappy-with-draft-electronics-policy/articleshow/67342931.cms
Jio plans affordable ultra-broadband for enterprise business transformation,"Mathew Oommen took a potshot at India’s older telcos, claiming businesses of every size have been deprived of telecom connectivity so far and Jio intends to bridge the gap with affordable offerings.","NEW DELHI: The next big fight in the telecom sector could be over enterprise customers, with Reliance Jio Infocomm planning to offer affordable ultra-broadband packages that could be transformational for millions of business customers currently without such high-speed internet connectivity.Speaking to ETTelecom, Jio president Mathew Oommen took a potshot at India’s older telcos, claiming businesses have been deprived of telecom connectivity so far and Jio intends to bridge that gap through its affordable offerings.India has 5,000 large enterprises and 1.4 million small and medium businesses, in addition to 51 million registered micro, small and medium enterprises, of which merely 1 million have wireline connectivity, Oommen said. Jio’s arch-rival Bharti Airtel has more than 1.7 million enterprise customers that contribute 22% of its revenue.“The next big transformation for businesses will be access to affordable ultra-broadband,” Oommen told ETTelecom. “Businesses have been deprived of telecom connectivity. Clearly, broadband has an important role to play here too.”Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-controlled Jio, which started operating in September 2016, is eyeing the enterprise segment on the back of its ultra-high-speed fibre-based nationwide network after disrupting the consumer mobile business, where it has racked up over 275 million subscribers, or more than a fifth of the nation’s total.Jio’s broadband service is under a pilot phase currently and the company has identified as many as 1,100 cities for a mega launch.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently unveiled an automated portal that allows a credit of up to Rs 1 crore to boost the MSME sector, which is considered the backbone of India’s economy with its vast production, export and job creation potential.“Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) control 38% of the GDP (gross domestic product) of this nation. Access to broadband will allow them to transform and help in not just reskilling, but will upskill as they participate fully in the digital economy,” Oommen said.The Jio senior executive said last-mile connectivity in India’s fibre networks is grossly below capacity compared with markets such as the US and China.The oil-to-telecom-to-retail conglomerate, which has already created a pure IP-based network, aims to offer ultra-high bandwidth to consumers with cost-effective futuristic technologies.Reliance Industries, Jio’s parent company, recently acquired a controlling stake in cable firms Hathway & Datacom and Den Networks, which would help the operator to accelerate its fibre initiative, significantly cutting down on capital expenditure per subscriber.Sunil Mittal-driven Bharti Airtel is acquiring Tikona, a Mumbai-based broadband provider that also offers service plans to small businesses. The deal faces a legal hurdle and is in court.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:56 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/jio-plans-packs-of-affordable-ultra-broadband/articleshow/67342961.cms
"High interest rates, insurance costs bring life of automakers to a crawl","Maruti Suzuki India’s (MSIL), the country’s largest carmaker, wholesale volumes grew by a meagre 1% to 119,804 units in the period under review. ","Passenger vehicle sales remained under pressure in December with high interest rates and increase in insurance costs deterring consumers from buying cars. Carmakers — which were saddled with high inventory following a weak showing this festive season — offered record discounts to liquidate stocks ahead of the new year. Automakers expect new launches will revive market sentiments and help boost volumes in the fourth quarter of the current financial year. Maruti Suzuki India’s (MSIL), the country’s largest carmaker, wholesale volumes grew by a meagre 1% to 119,804 units in the period under review. While sales of mini cars Alto and WagonR declined 14% to 27,661 units, those of compacts (Swift, Celerio, Baleno, Ignis and DZire) fell 3.8% to 51,334 units. However, sales of midsize sedan Ciaz nearly doubled to 4,734 units in the same period. Sales of utility vehicles too increased 4.9% to 20,225 units. The company separately sold 1,675 units of small commercial vehicle Super Carry. Exports for the company declined by 36.4% to 6,859 units, dragging overall volumes down by 1.3% to 128,338 units. Carmakers in India report wholesale dispatches made from factories and not actual sales to consumers. Maruti Suzuki, whose volumes have remained largely flat in the past six months, expects demand to improve in the new year. In a recent interaction, MSIL chairman RC Bhargava had said, “We have aggressive retail sales target for December which we expect to achieve. So, inventory at the beginning of January will be at low levels. We will launch a new model next quarter, which will help reverse the trend and push up volumes.” With the new WagonR lined up for launch later this month, Maruti Suzuki expects to capitalise on potential demand and grow wholesale volumes by 5% in the fourth quarter. Overall, the company expects volumes to go up by 8% — as against the initial double-digit growth target it had set for itself — for the entire fiscal year.   Korean rival Hyundai Motor fared better, selling 42,093 vehicles in December on the back of the newly launched Santro, Grand i10, Elite i20, Verna and Creta. The company’s sales rose 4.6% last month over 40,158 units sold in the corresponding period of 2017. Honda Cars India also posted a 4% increase in monthly sales numbers at 13,139 units. Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director (sales & marketing), HCIL, said, “The market continued to remain challenging in December. However, with lucrative year-end offers on many of our models and strong performance of new models Amaze and CR-V, HCIL recorded 4% sales growth in December 2018.” Tata Motors saw wholesale volumes rise by a modest 1% to 14,260 units. Meanwhile, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) saw wholesale volumes dip by 3% to 15,091units. “In the domestic market, challenges relating to tight liquidity and low buying sentiment continued in December. We hope to see good performance in Q4, owing to anticipated rural demand because of harvesting season and the launch of our new XUV300 in February 2019,” said Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, M&M. Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) bucked the trend to report 10% increase in wholesale volumes at 11,830 units, driven by demand for the Innova Crysta and the Fortuner. N Raja, deputy managing director, TKM said, “We are happy to close the year end with a series of positive milestones despite the dampening effect on consumer sentiment owing to rise in fuel prices, higher interest rates, increase in insurance premium.” Sales of commercial vehicles, too, were affected last month due to liquidity tightening in the market in the aftermath of the IL&FS crisis. Market leader Tata Motors reported 11% decline in sales of commercial vehicles at 36,180 units.   “In December 2018, consumer sentiments remained slightly subdued as customers were waiting to see a sustained level of improvement in factors such as fuel prices and profitability before deciding further investments in new vehicles”, the company said in a statement. At VE Commercial Vehicles, sales grew by 1% to 5,235 units. In the two-wheeler segment, Royal Enfield saw sales (domestic and exports) drop by 14% to 56,026 units.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/life-is-a-crawl-for-automakers/articleshow/67342939.cms
"For NBFCs, 2019 may be the year of reckoning",NBFCs would like to focus on direct assignment to ensure that risk is not on their balance sheet but they are able to raise fee income to maintain return on equity.,"About a third of the funds borrowed by Indians reach them through para banks, which reach the hinterland or the marginal customer where formal commercial banking hasn’t. This ability to bring formal finance to the doorstep of the unbanked has driven the growth at nonbanking finance companies (NBFC), but 2019 could well alter the operating environment for many of them.To begin with, NBFCs would have to put up with higher funding costs. In the October-December quarter, better-run NBFCs and HFCs got easier access to money compared to smaller or weaker NBFCs with poor track record and underwriting capabilities. In the past, robust growth of over 20% gave NBFCs access to debt capital regardless of stringent quality.“Hopefully, the NBFC sector which saw significant pressure in October-November is beginning to breathe a little better now,” said Uday Kotak in his address to employees. “However, I do believe that the NBFC sector is more fragile than what it was one year ago and, therefore, one has to watch that space carefully in the New Year.”The mismatch between longterm lending and borrowings will have to be addressed. Many HFCs have reduced their reliance on shorter-tenor commercial papers from highs of 18-20% to single digit. The flip side of lower reliance on market borrowing will lead to increase in cost of funds. NBFCs, with 25-30% borrowing from mutual funds, will have to diversify their borrowings. A report by Credit Suisse had said that mutual fund exposure to NBFC debt at 30% of their debt AUM is outsized and unlikely to sustain. And, 55% of this is short tenor.“It will be important to carry liquidity in their books and have a diversified liability side,” said Karthik Srinivasan, group head for financial sector ratings, Icra. “They will have to focus on retail NCDs, expand the lender base and add more banks to their borrowing list.” The Reserve Bank of India has talked about strengthening the regulatory vigil on the sector in general and on asset liability management (ALM) framework in particular in its latest report. The default by IL&FS on repayment of commercial papers shook the industry, making debt investors wary of investing in them.Borrowing higher-tenor funds will increase the cost.“As liabilities will be repriced faster than assets, their net interest margins will take a hit,” said Digant Haria, an analyst at Antique Broking.At present, ALM guidelines are applicable to non-deposit taking NBFCs with an asset size of ?100 crore and above and to those deposit taking companies that have a deposit base of 20 crore and above. ALM guidelines as prescribed for the sector relate to ALM information systems, ALM organisation including setting up of asset liability committee and its composition and the ALM process.MANAGING GROWTHStrong economic growth of the past four-five years that led to robust expansion of NBFCs will not last forever. Newer NBFCs will see their first downturn and companies with models that can withstand downturns will stand out.The sector with a size of 15% of bank’s balance sheet has been filling up the void created by public sector banks under prompt corrective actions. NBFCs and HFCs have been growing at 18-20% over the last two years. Growth is expected to take a hit in the first half of the calendar year. They are expected to report 300-400 basis points lower growth as a few NBFCs have stopped lending.“If an NBFC is facing problem raising long-tenor liability, it is may go into a shell,” said Haria.Retail loans of NBFCs grew at a robust 46.2% during 2017-18 — on top of a growth of 21.6% during 2016-17, reflecting upbeat consumer demand, especially in the vehicle loans segment. Growth in lending to commercial real estate rose due to sharp deceleration in banks’ credit to this sector. Industry contributes 50% of the lending portfolio, 22% is retail loans and 18% services, according to the latest RBI report.NBFCs are looking for newer avenues to diversify their lending portfolios. Companies will further have to expand the asset base to add newer products and reduce concentration in large clients.They will have to move deeper into cities to improve the risk adjusted return.Lenders will have to let go of lazy lending and reach out to new customers. Takeover of home loans from one by the other, which is estimated to have jumped to as much as 20% of all mortgages sanctioned, may have to be reduced as lenders incur cost while originating loans.CHANGING THE BUSINESS MODELNBFCs would like to focus on direct assignment to ensure that risk is not on their balance sheet but they are able to raise fee income to maintain return on equity.Large banks, including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, have been buying portfolios from top-rated NBFCs and HFCs. After recapitalisation of public sector banks, lenders under PCA will also be able to buy portfolios of NBFCs and HFCs.Also, RBI has allowed NBFCs to co-originate priority sector loans with banks. This will help NBFCs in managing low-cost funds from banks and lower their cost of operations. Although the sector had in the past two years weathered the effect of demonetisation and GST implementation, the liquidity stress will separate the winners from the also-rans.WATCH OUT FOR ASSET QUALITY“When lending slows down, there is an apprehension that delinquencies will go up as SME borrowers may face roll over issues,” said Srinivasan.NBFCs have maintained strong asset quality compared to banks. Since November 2014, the asset classification norms of NBFCs have been incrementally aligned with those of banks, leading to higher NPA recognition.However, both the gross nonperforming assets (GNPAs) ratio and the net non-performing assets ratio declined during 2017-18 to 5.8% and 3.8% as part of the portfolio of assets classified as NPAs were upgraded to standard assets compared to 2016-17.In the September quarter, the gross non-performing ratio deteriorated marginally and NBFCs made larger provisions and, hence, the NNPA ratio improved.DIVERSIFY BORROWING PROFILENBFCs deal with retail customers but have not used the segment for raising liability. When the going was good, Bajaj Finance learnt the lesson in 2013 and decided to build deposit franchise. Now, it borrows 15-20% of incremental lending through fixed deposit. NBFCs will have to expand into retail NCDs to tap into the existing customer franchise. High-rated NBFCs leverage 5-6 times while some large housing finance companies have leverage ratio touching 10 times. If they don’t get required funds, NBFCs will have to reduce leverage. This raises the need for NBFCs to be highly capitalised.NBFCs will have to diversify their borrowing profile from mostly debentures, commercial papers and banks to include instruments like external commercial borrowing, masala bonds and expand the number of banks.","Jan 02, 2019, 07:16 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/for-nbfcs-2019-may-be-the-year-of-reckoning/articleshow/67342932.cms

Maharashtra agency seeks cut in Ayushman Bharat premium," As many as 22 states have adopted the trust model, while others have opted for the hybrid model where the scheme will be managed jointly by insurance companies and the state.","The Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MPJAY) Society has recommended the Maharashtra government price the Ayushman Bharat national health protection scheme at Rs 640 per family from the agreed rate of Rs 690, said people with knowledge of the matter.The government is said to be in favour of retaining it at the latter level.MPJAY manages government health insurance programmes in Maharashtra. Insurance companies have gained from government efforts to bring down false claims, the society said, citing it as the reason for its demand.If insurers do not agree with this, the government could turn the scheme into a trust model, the MPJAY Society suggested. In the trust model, the state would directly pay hospitals.While the Niti Aayog had proposed a premium of Rs 1,032 per family under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, several states have negotiated lower rates. As many as 22 states have adopted the trust model, while others have opted for the hybrid model where the scheme will be managed jointly by insurance companies and the state.“For small schemes, we can go to insurance companies but for a scheme of this size, the trust model works better,” said an official closely associated with the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Maharashtra. Even the National Health Agency, the body that is overseeing Ayushman Bharat, is advocating the trust model, the official, who did not wish to be named, said, adding: “The insurance companies are pressuring the government; the state government will incur a loss of close to ?100 crore if they do not reduce the premium.”State health secretary Pradeep Vyas did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment.“It makes financial sense to reduce the premium,” said Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana.","Jan 02, 2019, 07:23 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/maharashtra-agency-seeks-cut-in-ayushman-bharat-premium/articleshow/67342993.cms
"India says Salut, Pernod Ricard raises a profit",India is also one of the most profitable markets for Pernod Ricard globally and its net profit is more than double compared to its larger rival United Spirits.,"Pernod Ricard, the world’s second largest distiller, saw its India revenues jump 23% while profits rose 28% in FY18, indicating a strong demand for premium brands, albeit on a favourable base last year. Pernod’s growth numbers outpaced Diageo’s Indian business that grew 3% in revenues. The maker of Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal scotch had gross sales of Rs 15,693 crore in the year-to-March 2018 with a net profit of Rs 1,228 crore, its latest filing with the Registrar of Companies showed. That’s a sharp revival for the company that posted sales growth of 6% while profits declined a year ago. Globally, the French company follows a financial year ending June and had said its Indian business had grown 14% during the period. “India saw a strong performance across portfolio, enhanced by favourable basis of comparison, in improving environment. We maintained market leadership, with over 45% value market share (bottled in India premium and western style spirits whiskies),” Alexandre Ricard, chairman of Pernod Ricard, had said at an investors’ call in August. India is the second largest market for Pernod Ricard globally, only behind the US and bigger than the home market, France. The French distiller has been expanding its Indian business in double digits for more than a decade, bucking the broader industry trend of slowing growth. A year ago, Pernod India trimmed over 100 people from its workforce, who have been given one and a half year of severance pay, according to officials. Analysts also expect the growth momentum to continue. “The very strong first quarter benefitted from an easy basis of comparable. This normalises into 2019 where we estimate growth of about 16%, reflecting a double digit underlying runrate with some benefit from the opening up of Uttar Pradesh,” Edward Mundy and Elsa Hannar, analysts at Jefferies International, wrote in a recent investor note. “Medium term, we see a sustainable run-rate at low double-digits to mid-teens. We believe that the risk of inclusion of grain-neutral spirit in GST has moderated.”India is also one of the most profitable markets for Pernod Ricard globally and its net profit is more than double compared to its larger rival United Spirits. That’s because USL has more than about 100 brands, mostly in the mass segment in its portfolio such as Bagpiper and DSP Black, but the top 15 brands contribute more than 80% to its sales led by McDowell and Celebration. In comparison, Pernod India gets a significant chunk from premium and semi-premium brands, mainly Royal Stag and Imperial Blue. However, this is changing - after British spirits giant acquired USL more than five years ago, there has been a strong focus on premium segments, which is now contributing nearly 66% to its overall sales, up from around 45-50% around the time of its acquisition. The overall liquor market in the country saw sluggish demand in the aftermath of disruptions such as demonetisation and the new tax regime. These challenges were further accentuated by complete prohibition in Bihar, the Supreme Court’s ban on liquor vendors along highways and other taxrelated changes that dragged the sector’s growth from the high-teens to as low as 4% over the past three years.","Jan 02, 2019, 07:23 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/liquor/india-says-salut-pernod-ricard-raises-a-profit/articleshow/67343007.cms
WPP leases 3-L sq ft property from K Raheja Corp for 9 years,"The majority of WPP's Mumbai businesses will be housed in this building and the company is targeting the second half of 2019 to complete the move, said  CVL Srinivas.","Advertising major WPP has taken the entire office section of the ORB complex near Mumbai airport—spread over 3 lakh sq ft—from K Raheja Corp on lease for nine years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the development.While WPP India country manager CVL Srinivas confirmed that a deal has taken place, the persons cited earlier said the lease rentals are set at Rs 125 per sq ft a month and the agreement has a 15% upward rental reset clause every three years.The move is in line with WPP’s strategy of creating campuses in key cities and will help the company consolidate its businesses, including those of larger group companies Group M, IMRB and O&M, according to Srinivas.""The plan to establish the WPP Mumbai Campus is in line with our global strategy of establishing WPP campuses in key cities. India is a leading growth market for WPP,” Srinivas said. “To support our already strong local presence, we are developing an exciting new workspace that will help to drive more collaboration and enable our clients to have the best access to our talent and work.”These WPP group companies will be vacating their current offices at Oberoi Commerz in Goregaon and Lower Parel’s Peninsula corporate park to shift to the new building.The majority of WPP's Mumbai businesses will be housed in this building and the company is targeting the second half of 2019 to complete the move, said Srinivas.ET’s email query to K Raheja Corp remained unanswered until the time of going to press. Transaction advisor JLL India declined to comment.WPP, the leading global agency network, provides a comprehensive range of services including digital, ecommerce and shopper marketing, advertising and media investment management, data investment management, public relations and public affairs, brand consulting, health and wellness communications, and specialist communications.As part of its global campus co-location strategy, apart from the newly leased office in Mumbai, the company will soon be signing a similar lease for its Gurgaon office, sources said.In India, WPP Group employs close to 20,000 people across offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad, besides a few other cities. Almost 30%, or around 6,000, of these employees are in Mumbai, who are expected to shift to the new office.The company has maintained that India is a key growth region for the company and that it has a well-defined road map and vision for what the company would like to achieve here.Globally, WPP is encouraging a greater collaboration across agencies by merging its disparate brand offices into large, campus-style hubs. The strategy is being rolled out across the globe to better service clients.In June last year, WPP had leased 700,000 sq ft of space spread over 13 floors of the Three World Trade Centre in New York that houses agencies like Mediacom, Mindshare, Essence, Wavemaker and Xaxis, as well as Kantar brands.While WPP will also be co-locating all its agency brands into a single office in Toronto soon, GroupM had already housed its agencies together in locations such as Amsterdam.WPP is also creating a campus in Prague, which will bring together 12 of its agencies under one roof.

Sun shines on fewer companies but they’re big on solar,"Roughly five years ago when the industry was still finding its bearings, it was a pool that every kid wanted to jump in to but a streak of consolidation activity in the solar industry has separated the wheat from the chaff.","The sun is slowly rising on India’s solar sector. Following the NDA-led government’s ambitious target to achieve 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022 of which 100 GW is to come from solar, the industry has witnessed an ebb tide — with more than a hundred players operating around 2010, barely 20-odd players are feeling the sun shining rather pleasantly on them today.Roughly five years ago when the industry was still finding its bearings, it was a pool that every kid wanted to jump in to but a streak of consolidation activity in the solar industry has separated the wheat from the chaff. Well-funded companies are adding aggressively to their portfolios, and significantly defining the trajectory of solar tariffs – crashing rates are sending the spirits of consumers high, meaning larger integration of renewable energy into the grid.Operating world’s one of the largest solar projects in Tamil Nadu, Adani Green Energy has invested $2 billion in its solar business to emerge as the leading player with operational portfolio in India. The company, growing largely on strong financial backing, plans to add 5 GW capacity over the next two to three years.“Financial prudence and financial backing, along with strong execution skills will be key to sustaining in the sector going forward,” said Sagar Adani, executive director of Adani Green Energy.Sumant Sinha, whose clean energy venture ReNew Power is backed by big-ticket investors such as Goldman Sachs and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, counts on his company’s capital structure, and access to multiple sources of funding as one of the key drivers of ReNew’s growth.“We benefit from a robust balance sheet, which we leverage prudently to support our growth. We have raised a mix of equity, project finance and corporate debt,” said Sinha, CMD of ReNew.The key to remain in the big boys’ club is to maintain a cautious approach to growth, according to CEO of Hero Future Energies (HFE), Sunil Jain.For players with deep pockets, the industry is spattered with projects up for sale. The consolidation drive in the renewable energy market came early on and started with a bang with Tata Power acquiring Welspun’s solar assets for $1.4 billion in 2016. This kicked off a spate of consolidation activity, and ReNew’s Sinha made headlines with the acquisition of Ostro’s wind and solar assets for a whopping $1.6 billion earlier this year.“Solar is a very simple technology with low entry barriers. Hence, the only sources of competitive advantage are ability to raise large amounts of cheap institutional money plus procurement scale,” said Vinay Rustagi, MD of renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India.This explains why smaller players may want to exit but the struggle to dust static portfolios off their hands remains.Solar power tariffs have fallen by over 64% in the last five years, and sub-Rs 3 level has become the new normal in the last one year or so. Last year, solar power reached grid-parity, becoming cheaper than thermal power – an important landmark that gave the government another reason to market solar power with gusto. Falling tariffs, however, is making developers uncomfortable.“The solar power industry has witnessed falling tariffs in recent times. This trend could have affect the profitability of power projects in future. If companies miscalculate or misjudge tariff rates and incorrectly factor the costs of construction, development, land acquisition and price of components (including due to increase in duties and other levies), the economics of the bid may be affected and the project may become unviable,” Sinha said. Despite falling tariffs and shrinking profit margins, companies continue to aggressively add to their solar portfolios. With over 2,000 MW of solar projects in pipeline, ACME Solar, led by Manoj Upadhyay, has the largest kitty of underconstruction solar projects in India. The company quoted a record-low solar tariff at Rs 2.44 per unit last year in an auction conducted by Solar Energy Corporation of India. It bagged 2,635 MW of utility scale solar project last year.Another head-turner is Softbank-owned SB Energy. It has bagged over 2,000 MW of solar capacity this year; the company’s operating portfolio as of September 2018 year stood at 750 MW.“Even though Softbank has a fairly small solar portfolio, we cannot afford to ignore them,” said an industry insider. The fear of developers around Softbank’s entry in the Indian solar sector, is validated by the company’s $1 trillion investment proposal in the sector it made to PM Modi earlier this year.While serious players continue to exhibit their keenness in India’s solar story, the government has also gone a step ahead in capping solar tariffs, sparking fears that the current tariffs could create nonperforming assets, as it did in its thermal counterpart.The ultimate winner, turns out, will be the consumer, who gains in terms of reduced cost of electricity. Power distribution companies, as they continue to hanker after cheaper solar power, will keep private players on their toes, until solar as a source of energy takes over conventional power sources to become economically viable.

Congress misused CBI to target Amit Shah: Smriti Irani,Irani termed Shah’s arrest by CBI in the case a “political conspiracy” hatched by the Congress and its then president Sonia Gandhi as they saw Narendra Modi and Shah as rivals.,"At a time when the NDA government is facing Opposition charge of interfering in CBI affairs, BJP has alleged that the Congress-led UPA government had misused the probe agency to target its chief Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case by ‘manufacturing evidence’ to politically destroy him.Union textile minister Smriti Irani told reporters that Shah had come out unscathed in this “trial by fire”. She took on Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on the issue. Her remarks come in the wake of a tweet by Rahul that “nobody “killed” Sheikh, his wife Kauser Bi and close associate Tulsi Prajapati in police encounters; “they just died”. A special CBI court had acquitted all 22 people named in Sheikh’s encounter.During UPA rule, Amit Shah—who was Gujarat home minister when these encounters took place between 2005 and 2006—was incarcerated for some time in 2010 in these cases. He was given a clean chit in December 2014, months after the Lok Sabha election.Irani termed Shah’s arrest by CBI in the case a “political conspiracy” hatched by the Congress and its then president Sonia Gandhi as they saw Narendra Modi and Shah as rivals.“Congress and its president used CBI to manufacture evidence to politically destroy Shah. It is one of the finest examples of the length to which the Congress will go to destroy its political opponents,” she told reporters.“Truth cannot be destroyed”, she added, and emphasised that Shah underwent a trial by fire. His arrest in 2010 was at the behest of the Congress first family, she alleged.She further alleged that Congress has no scruples in trampling justice. Rahul’s tweet was “an expression of frustration,” she said.Irani alleged that Congress uses power not to serve people but “one family” and will not spare anybody who comes in the way.Irani noted that activist Harsh Mander, who she claimed was a member of Sonia Gandhi’s “kitchen cabinet”, had moved the Supreme Court against Shah’s discharge.Irani read from the Mumbai court’s order that criticised the CBI probe and said the agency “created evidence” to suit its “preconceived and premeditated” theory to implicate political leaders.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:33 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/congress-misused-cbi-to-target-amit-shah-smriti-irani/articleshow/67343066.cms

"UP Gets Rs 1,500 crore grant for meeting deadline on 100% electrification","The achievement came as a surprise to many as at the beginning of December, the state had faced a daunting task of energizing 55 lakh households.","Uttar Pradesh, once the biggest roadblocks to the Centre’s complete electrification programme, will get close to Rs 1,500 crore grant as it finished the household electrification drive within the stipulated deadline of December 31.The achievement came as a surprise to many as at the beginning of December, the state had faced a daunting task of energizing 55 lakh households.A government official said the state overestimated un-electrified households. Also, houses with illegal connections have now been identified as electrified, helping in reducing the targets. The overall targets for the country under the scheme have also come down from the initially estimated 4 crore to 3.5 crore, and finally by the end of the year, to 2.49 crore.The Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, or Saubhagya, envisages providing energy access to all by March 2019 and includes release of electricity connections by drawing a cable from the nearest electricity pole to the household premise, installation of energy meter wiring for a single light point with LED bulb and a mobile charging point.The Saubhagya scheme was launched on September 25, 2017, at a cost of Rs 16,320 crore including gross budgetary support of Rs 12,320 crore from the Centre.The states that completed the scheme by December 31would be given an additional 15% grant by the Centre as incentive. The scheme is being funded to the extent of 60% by central grants, 30% by bank loans and 10% by states.Barring Rajasthan, Assam, Chhattisgarh and Meghalaya, all states have achieved 100% household electrification.On Monday, Uttar Pradesh, which hosted close to half of the targeted un-electrified households, announced achieveinmg100% electrification, a statement issued by the power ministry said.Since the launch of Saubhagya, 74.4 lakh willing households have been electrified and the state government has declared saturation of all 75 districts. The state has launched a door-to-door campaign for any of those left out in un-electrified households. The Saubhagya dashboard showed that of the 2,49,01,600 households that have been identified, 96.15% have been energized, while 3.85%, or 9,57,950, households are remaining.Karnataka and Arunachal Pradsh attained full electrification on Tuesday. The power ministry expects to complete electrification of all targeted households by January 26. The ministry had earlier planned to complete the programme by Monday against the original deadline of March 31.On an average, about seven lakh houses are being energised every week. Experts have said the newly connected households will get translated into growth in power demand within a year with the release of pent-up and fresh demand from rural areas.","Jan 02, 2019, 07:44 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/up-gets-rs-1500-crore-grant-for-meeting-deadline-on-100-electrification/articleshow/67343106.cms
"Oil starts 2019 with gains, as traders gear up for volatile year",West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot crude oil futures were at $45.85 per barrel.,"SINGAPORE: Oil markets began 2019 in positive territory on Wednesday, as traders prepare for a likely volatile year of trading amid soaring US crude supply and concerns about a global economic slowdown. International Brent crude futures were at $54.31 per barrel at 0126 GMT, up 51 cents, or 1 per cent from their final close of 2018. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot crude oil futures were at $45.85 per barrel, up 44 cents, or 1 per cent. Traders said crude futures were lifted by a rise in stock markets, although overall oil market sentiment remains relatively weak. Oil prices ended 2018 with losses for the first time since 2015, after a desultory fourth quarter that saw buyers flee the market over growing worries about a supply glut and mixed signals related to renewed US sanctions on Iran. ""Oil prices ... registered their first yearly decline in three years on fears of a slowing global economy and concerns of an ongoing supply glut,"" said Adeel Minhas, a consultant at Australia's Rivkin Securities. For the year, US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures slumped nearly 25 per cent, while Brent tumbled nearly 20 per cent. The outlook for 2019 is riddled with uncertainty, analysts said, including US-China trade concerns and Brexit, as well as political instability and conflict in the Middle East. A Reuters poll showed oil prices are expected to trade below $70 per barrel in 2019 as surplus production, much of it from the United States, and slowing economic growth undermine efforts led by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut supply and prop up prices. On the production side, all eyes will be on the ongoing surge in US output and on OPEC's and Russia's supply discipline. ""Don't underestimate shale producers and the wider US oil industry in general. Too often this year the market pushed stories ... bottlenecks (pipelines, frack crews, truck drivers, etc.), yet US oil production will have grown by a massive 2+ million barrels per day between 1.1.2018 and 1.1.2019,"" consultancy JBC Energy said in an analysis of 2018.

Algos aren’t causing the wild stock market swings,,"The wild swings and see-sawing of markets these last few days was unprecedented in many ways. But one aspect of the week ended up being very predictable: Like clockwork after any sudden jolt and market event, big investors come out and point the finger at algorithms.The argument goes something like this: Electronic trading programs feed off each other to cause an “invisible herding effect” that amplifies price moves, capable of turning a minor downward market trajectory into a full-blown bloodbath, all in a matter of milliseconds. Now that electronic trading makes up huge swathes of the market, a sea change from only a few decades ago, it’s obvious that robot traders are causing the plunges and rallies like those of this week.“Electronic traders are wreaking havoc in the markets,” Leon Cooperman, the billionaire stock picker who founded hedge fund Omega Advisors, told the Wall Street Journal.JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief global strategist, David Kelly, also chimed in this week, blaming algorithm-led passive investment vehicles for the Christmas week volatility. And next year might be worse: Star economist Torsten Slok at Deutsche Bank said an “algodriven fire sale” might be one of the big risks of 2019.Again and again, market structure experts have pushed back against this oversimplified narrative. But much of the counterbalance is seldom noticed. (Perhaps jargon like “latency arbitrage” in 30-plus page reports from institutions with unsexy names like the Bank for International Settlements are less than headline grabbing.) But there are plenty of holes to poke in this theory: For one, as trading news site Curatia notes, linking the increase of the machines to the rise in volatility doesn’t even work from a timing standpoint.“Huge, rapid stock swings occurred well before the advent of algorithmic trading,” it said. “On the whole, the electronification era remains one of the lowest-volatility periods on record despite the rise of high-frequency trading. And the recent surge in volatility doesn’t correlate with any specific increase in market automation.”Adding to the complexity - besides the boom in algos, the market has changed in so many other ways, too.There’s been an explosion in different types of trading venues, both inside and outside of big banks, that has created more tectonic plate-like platforms in the market. That can make “price discovery” trickier. This is especially true in periods of low liquidity, or thinned out buying and selling, which tends to happen over the holiday period.And there was plenty of humanled activity going on in the world this year that was arguably scarier to investors than any Skynet-style cyborg speed trader: Federal Reserve policy, the US-China trade war, the “leveraged loan” boom, eurozone drama, emerging-market turmoil, volatile oil prices, and Brexit, to list just a few.

This new era will leap ahead of current wireless technology, known as 4G, by offering mobile internet speeds that will let people download entire movies within seconds and most likely bring big changes to video games, sports and shopping. Officials in the United States and China see 5G networks as a competitive edge. The faster networks could help spread the use of artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies. Expect to hear more about 5G soon at events like the big consumer electronics trade show CES in January in Las Vegas and MWC Barcelona (formerly the Mobile World Congress) in February in Spain. Wireless service providers including AT&T and Verizon are already talking up 5G. And device makers are previewing gadgets that will work with the technology. Samsung recently demonstrated prototypes of 5G smartphones that are expected to operate on both Verizon and AT&T networks. Many other manufacturers are racing to follow suit, though Apple is not expected in the initial 5G wave. Analysts predict that iPhones with the new technology won’t arrive until 2020. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Here’s what you need to know.WHAT EXACTLY IS 5G?Strictly speaking, 5G is a set of technical ground rules that define the workings of a cellular network, including the radio frequencies used and how various components like computer chips and antennas handle radio signals and exchange data. Since the first cellphones were demonstrated in the 1970s, engineers from multiple companies have convened to agree on new sets of specifications for cellular networks, which are designated a new technology generation every decade or so. To get the benefits of 5G, users will have to buy new phones, while carriers will need to install new transmission equipment to offer the faster service.HOW FAST WILL 5G BE?The answer depends on where you live, which wireless services you use and when you decide to take the 5G plunge. Qualcomm said it had demonstrated peak 5G download speeds of 4.5 gigabits a second, but predicts initial median speeds of 1.4 gigabits. That translates to roughly 20 times faster than the current 4G experience. The 5G speeds will be particularly noticeable in higher-quality streaming video. And downloading a typical movie at the median speeds cited by Qualcomm would take 17 seconds with 5G, compared with six minutes for 4G. Rather than remembering to download a season of a favorite TV show before heading to the airport, for example, you could do it while in line to board a plane, said Justin Denison, a Samsung senior vice president.IS THAT THE ONLY SPEED THAT MATTERS?No. There’s another kind of speed, a lag known as latency, that may become even more important with 5G. Issue a command now on a smartphone — like starting a web search and the response isn’t exactly immediate. A lag of 50 to several hundred milliseconds is common, partly because signals often must pass between different carrier switching centers; 5G, which uses newer networking technology, was designed to reduce latency down to a few milliseconds. It was also designed to deliver signals more reliably than earlier cellular networks, which today frequently drop bits of data that aren’t essential for tasks like watching movies on a phone. That improvement could bring many benefits in virtual reality. The highest-quality VR applications now require bulky headsets that are connected by wire to nearby PCs that generate 3D images. With 5G, that would be off-loaded wirelessly to other machines, freeing users to move and making it easier to develop goggles, said Cristiano Amon, President of Qualcomm’s semiconductor business.","Jan 02, 2019, 07:48 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/tech/get-up-to-speed-with-5g-and-stay-ahead-of-the-game/articleshow/67343042.cms

World stocks nurse a New Year's hangover as growth worries persist,"Fed fund futures now imply a quarter-point cut by mid-2020 instead.
","LONDON: World shares started 2019 on a downbeat note, oil prices and bond yields slid, and the Japanese yen strengthened on Wednesday as data from China to France confirmed the picture of a global economic slowdown.European shares were knocked lower and Wall Street equity futures fell two per cent, after US equities closed 2018 with the worst losses since the 2008 global crisis.MSCI's index of world shares dropped 0.4 per cent as weak manufacturing-activity surveys across Asia were followed by disappointing numbers in the euro zone.China in particular saw factory activity contracting for the first time in over two years. Mainland Chinese shares fell 1.2 per cent and S&P 500 futures gave up early gains.The gloom continued in Europe, where the Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone reached its lowest since February 2016. Future output PMIs were at a six-year low .A pan-European share index tumbled 1.3 per cent, led by 2 per cent-plus losses in Paris, as France's PMI fell in December for the first time in two years.""It's a continuation of the worries over growth. You can see them in the Asian numbers, which all confirm that we have passed peak growth levels,"" said Tim Graf, chief macro strategist at State Street Global Advisors.The knock-on effects from China's slowdown and global trade tensions were rippling across Asia and Europe, he said.""I don't think the trade story goes away, and Europe, being an open economy, is still vulnerable plus there is less monetary policy support than there has been,"" he said, in a reference to the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme, which ended on Dec. 31.Steel futures, a key gauge of world growth sentiment, lost as much as 1.5 per cent in Shanghai trade. Oil prices sagged -- Brent crude futures fell 1 per cent after losing 19.5 per cent in 2018 .Commodity-driven currencies lost ground in turn, led by the Australian dollar. Often used as a proxy for China sentiment, the Aussie fell as much as 0.7 per cent to its lowest since February 2016 at $0.70015.There were also renewed fears in Europe over the clean-up of Italy's banks, with trading in shares of Banca Carige suspended. Carige failed last month to win shareholder backing for a share issue that was part of a rescue plan. An Italian bank shares index fell 2.2 per cent.SAFETY The stock market rout drove investors into the safety of bonds from countries such as the United States and Germany, with the 10-year German Bund yield slumping to 20-month lows of 0.18 per cent It stood at 0.3 per cent a month ago.""This drop in Bund yields is a reflection of a weakness in equities and overall risk sentiment. China is one of the main drivers,"" Commerzbank strategist Rainer Guntermann said.Gold and the yen were he other beneficiaries.While gold topped six-month highs, the yen extended its rally against the dollar to seven-month highs around 108.9 . It strengthened to a 19-month peak against the euro .The dollar edged up on the euro and sterling but was steady versus a basket of currencies at 96.181.The greenback has been dragged down by a steep fall in Treasury yields in recent weeks -- investors wager the US Federal Reserve will not raise rates again, even though the Fed itself is still projecting at least two more hikes.Fed fund futures now imply a quarter-point cut by mid-2020 instead.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will have the chance to comment on the economic outlook when he takes part in a discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday.Also looming are the closely watched US manufacturing survey due on Thursday and Friday's December payrolls report.Yields on two-year debt have tumbled to 2.49 per cent, just barely above the cash rate, from a peak of 2.977 per cent in November. Ten-year yields have dived to their lowest since last February at 2.69 per cent.The spread between two- and 10-year yields has in turn shrunk to the smallest since 2007, a flattening that has been a portent of recessions in the past.

Complaints with bank ombudsman surge 25% in FY18,"Of all the complaints received at the ombudsman's offices, 97% of them were resolved in 2017-18, up from 92% a year earlier.","By Ashwin Manikandan Mumbai: The number of complaints registered at banking ombudsman offices have seen a 25% increase in the fiscal year 2018, with majority of these complaints coming from urban centres owing to increased awareness and poor internal redressal mechanisms of banks. ""The banking ombudsman offices in tier-1 cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad accounted for more than 57% of the total complaints received by all BO offices,"" the RBI Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India has stated. ""The higher proportion of complaints from urban areas in recent years is largely due to increasing awareness about grievance redressal mechanism among bank customers and also the efficacy of internal grievance redressal mechanism in banks, not being up to the desired level.""Of all the complaints received at the ombudsman's offices, 97% of them were resolved in 2017-18, up from 92% a year earlier.Currently, there are 21 functional banking ombudsman offices in the country. These offices were established under Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006, and are the first points of contact for consumers seeking grievance redressals and resolutions against consumer frauds and discrepancies in the banking system.  Most complaints received at these offices were related to non-observance of the fair practices code followed by those related to ATM, credit and debit cards, and for failure to meet commitments and mobile banking.In bank-wise distribution, most complaints received against public sector banks were pension-related while most complaints received against private banks were for credit cards discrepancies. The RBI plans to set up a compliance and tracking system portal to tackle the problem of cyber-fraud under the ombudsman scheme taking in light the growing impetus of banks and financial institutions on digital transactions and the Centre's push to a less cash economy.","Jan 02, 2019, 07:49 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/complaints-with-bank-ombudsman-surge-25-in-fy18/articleshow/67343269.cms
MSCI status quo on weight cap brings relief to India,,"In a big relief to India and some other emerging markets, MSCI has announced that it would not take any immediate action against them for limiting investor access, ruling out punitive measures that could have affected overseas fund flows to these countries.The global index provider had earlier planned to cap India’s weight on the MSCI-EM index after local exchanges suggested curbs on data sharing with the Singapore bourse. Changes in the MSCI EM index could have a direct impact on the $14 billion of overseas cash invested in India by foreign portfolio managers that keenly track the MSCI EM index.While announcing the conclusions from its recent consultation with the investment community on potential enhancements to the MSCI Market Classification Framework, the index provider said that MSCI would not adopt a rule that would have mechanically and automatically reduced the weights of markets in the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes to account for restrictions on the availability of investment instruments.  “As part of the consultation feedback, international institutional investors preferred for now that MSCI continues to review the limited availability of investment instruments on a case-by-case basis, in line with the Market Classification Framework and not mechanically and automatically apply a single rule to all potential instances,” said the MSCI announcement.It means that the “immediate risk of putting a cap on the weighting or lowering the weighting of India and some other emerging countries on MSCI indices is off,” said a foreign fund manager.India, the fourth-biggest country with a weighting of 8.9 per cent in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, is tracked by $1.6-trillion of passive wealth.“MSCI maintaining status quo on the Indian markets is a big positive, which will ensure the flows of passive funds into Indian stocks,” said Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Mutual Funds.In May last year, MSCI said that it is considering placing a few emerging markets, including India, on notice after those markets introduced certain restrictions on market accessibility. The controversy started after the three domestic bourses — the NSE, the BSE and the Metropolitan Stock Exchange — in February last year announced the cancellation of licensing agreements with overseas exchanges.MSCI accused countries such as India of imposing market accessibility restrictions that would not fully impair international institutional investors from accessing or investing, but that may nevertheless make the market less accessible and investable.“It’s difficult to put restrictions on the Indian markets, as in many other countries like China, as there are more stringent rules for investor access,” said the head of India equities at a foreign bank. “Even if MSCI lowers weights, foreign investors have other options to access Indian markets through the FPI route.”MSCI officials from overseas met several government and exchange officials locally, starting in June, to sort out the market accessibility issues.

","BENGALURU: Gold scaled a more than six-month peak on Wednesday as the dollar fell along with Asian equities after disappointing data from China cemented fears of a slowdown in global economic growth.Spot gold was up 0.3 per cent at $1,286.18 an ounce as of 0712 GMT, after hitting its highest since June 15, 2018 at $1,287.31 earlier in the session.US gold futures rose 0.5 per cent to $1,288.10 per ounce.""It looks very optimistic and fundamentally supportive for gold as the overall mood is still very uncertain and the market confidence is still weak on global growth worries,"" said Benjamin Lu Jiaxuan, a commodities analyst at Phillip Futures.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was hovering near a two-month low hit in the previous session.A softer dollar makes the greenback denominated bullion cheaper for investors holding other currencies.Also, Asian shares turned tail on the first trading day of the new year as more disappointing economic data from China, the world's second-largest economy, darkened the mood and erased early gains in US stock futures.The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, marking the first contraction since May 2017, and followed a raft of soft trade data from the Asian region.""The global economy has entered into an uncharted territory considering the fact that the Chinese data was worse than expected,"" said Kunal Shah, head of research at Nirmal Bang Commodities in Mumbai, India.""With uncertainties on global economy and geopolitical concerns, it's just a matter of time gold is going to shoot up.""Markets were looking for views from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the US economic outlook and hints about rate hikes in 2019 when he participates in a joint discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday.Also looming are a closely-watched survey on US manufacturing due on Thursday, followed by the December payrolls report on Friday.There are expectations that a three-year rate-hiking cycle in the United States has come to a close.

Ministries told not to directly engage with US on trade issues,"The US has been trying to seek unconditional market access for its dairy products in India, besides incentives and tariff concessions for its ICT products including mobile phones.","The Cabinet Secretariat has instructed ministries, including information technology, agriculture and animal husbandry, not to directly engage with the US on trade issues and instead go through the department of commerce.This comes after some US officials approached other ministries in an attempt to push their demands.The US has been trying to seek unconditional market access for its dairy products in India, besides incentives and tariff concessions for its ICT products including mobile phones – issues that are being discussed in the trade package that the two countries are negotiating.“Individual ministries have been told not to negotiate with the US directly but go through the commerce department because they are the ones negotiating the trade package,” said an official aware of the development, adding that no formal directive has been issued.The US wants a special dispensation comprising export sops and duty cuts for high-end mobile phones costing over Rs 10,000, which India can’t give selectively to the US. World Trade Organization norms do not permit member-nations to extend country-specific benefits.If the government yields, China, too, would benefit from these incentives and this would adversely impact India, which already has a huge trade deficit.“The US does its advocacy through other departments like agriculture and animal husbandry. ...they do that with all countries. However, on trade and commerce issues, it is the commerce department which does all negotiations,” said another official.“The US is known to try all tricks when it negotiates a deal with any country and India needs to be cautious of indirect lobbying.

How a powerless position made a CEO quit her job,Reaching the helm may not be the best promotion sometimes.,"Everyone has boss problems. In this anonymous space, we get people to talk about a conflict and how they dealt with the situation.Reaching the helm may not be the best promotion sometimes. The CEO of a global luxury giant recounts her tenure at her previous company that compelled her to take a hard, yet the best, decision.Her profile was raised to lead the company’s business unit, but the delight was short-lived. She had no actual decision-making powers. “Being responsible for a business unit without the flexibility to take decisions is one of the worst situations to be in. I was doing my best, but the owner just couldn’t see the effort. It was hard to understand their true intentions,” she says.The same owner that promoted her couldn’t see her worth. It was a paradox that made her question her selfworth daily. This, however, became the turning point. She quit the company where she had put her heart and soul for three years. With a heavy heart, she let go. “It can be frustrating to search for a new adventure. Easier said than done, but take the risk,” she advises. The bold step landed her a plum job with a top luxury brand, which she currently heads as its global CEO. Taking A Stand: How Tech Bosses Brought About A ChangeAutoplay1 of 6Speaking OutA culture revolution doesn’t always begin on the outside. Sometimes, accountability comes from the inside, as these powerful tech giants discovered. Tiptoeing The Line Earlier this year, Microsoft came under scrutiny when over a hundred employees published an open letter calling on the company to cancel its contracts with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. “We believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits,” the letter said. CEO Satya Nadella (in pic) defended the contract stating, “Microsoft is not working with the US government on any project related to separating children from their families at the border.” Nadella did not commit to more transparency.Technology For GoodEarlier this year, hundreds of Amazon employees signed an internal letter demanding that the company stop selling its facial recognition surveillance software — Rekognition — to law enforcement agencies. “As ethically concerned Amazonians, we demand a choice in what we build and a say in how it is used,” they wrote. Despite the outcry, Amazon executives have skirted around the issue saying that it is the responsibility of the US government to specify the regulations needed around facial recognition. In pic: Amazon CEO Jeff BezosPersonal Vs. Company Last month, Facebook executives came under fire when the company’s VP of global public policy — Joel Kaplan (left) — was spotted publicly supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh as he testified before the Senate. Kaplan’s appearance raised eyebrows and resulted in a strong backlash among employees with some viewing Kaplan’s show of support as an endorsement from the company itself. Following the outrage, Kaplan apologised and defended his actions, claiming that he had attended the hearing as a close friend of Kavanaugh. “I’ve talked to Joel about why I think it was a mistake for him to attend given his role in the company. We support people’s right to do what they want in their personal time but this was by no means a straight-forward case,” Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (right) wrote in an internal post.Walking Out Last week, more than 20,000 Google employees staged a worldwide walkout over reports that former executive Andy Rubin (left) received a handsome $90 million severance package in 2014, despite sexual misconduct allegations. Reacting to the protests, Google CEO Sundar Pichai (right) said, “People are walking out because they want us to improve and they want us to show we can do better. We’re acknowledging and understanding we clearly got some things wrong.” Shortly after, Google announced new sexual harassment policies for employees including a crackdown on alcohol at work-related functions.

ISRO’s new station in Bhutan to counter China’s Tibet facility,"China has established an advanced satellite tracking centre and astronomical observatory at Ngari in Tibet Autonomous Region, about 125 km away from the Line of Actual Control, which serves as the de-facto border between India & China.","India is setting up a satellite tracking and data reception centre in the Himalayan state of Bhutan that will also strategically serve to counter a similar Chinese facility in the region. The Indian Space Research Organisation’s ground station in Bhutan is likely to double up as “a strategic asset” for the country, given its location between India and China, people aware of the matter told ET.China has established an advanced satellite tracking centre and astronomical observatory at Ngari in Tibet Autonomous Region, about 125 km away from the Line of Actual Control, which serves as the de-facto border between India and China. The facility in Tibet is so advanced that apart from tracking Indian satellites, it can also “blind” them, the people said. Although ISRO’s ground station in Bhutan is intended to help the Himalayan state take advantage of the South Asia Satellite, it is also India’s way of counterbalancing the Chinese station in Tibet.This strategy is significant in the backdrop of the Doklam crisis, when the Chinese tried to construct a road at a tri-junction between India, Bhutan and China. Bhutan stood firmly with India during the 72-day face-off between the Indian army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army at Doklam in western Bhutan in June-August, 2017. At the PM-level talks here last Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said construction of the ISRO ground station in Bhutan would be completed soon.“Space science is the new dimension of our cooperation (with Bhutan),” he said in a statement after meeting new Bhutanese Prime Minister Lotay Tshering. “With the completion of this project, Bhutan will get help in tasks such as weather information, tele-medicine and disaster relief in the far-flung areas of the country.” ISRO launched the South Asia Satellite on May 5, 2017. Modi had in 2014 mooted the idea of a satellite for members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation so that India could share the benefits of advances in space technology with its South Asian neighbours. India also pledged Rs 4,500 crore as assistance to Bhutan to support the Himalayan state’s 12th five-year plan for development.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:08 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/isros-new-station-in-bhutan-to-counter-chinas-tibet-facility/articleshow/67343292.cms
‘Global economy is on an irreversible path to a downturn’,,"One Wall Street strategist warns the end of the global economy’s current cycle is near.In fact, the path to a downturn is “irreversible,” according to Naka Matsuzawa, chief Japan rates strategist at Nomura.“The global economy is already on an irreversible path to an economic downturn,” he wrote, in a sweeping report, translated to English from Japanese, about his macro investment strategies for 2019.“However, we do not expect the economy to fall suddenly into a downturn, but to recover temporarily in the second half of 2019 to the first half of 2020 after signs of a slowdown strengthen through the first half of 2019.”Matsuzawa’s view is more or less consistent with other experts. Some market strategists and business leaders are not calling for an immediate recession, but think that sometime in 2020 the risks will rise. A recent report from Deutsche Bank placed the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 months as “very low.” Still, economists are keeping an eye on the flattening Treasury yield curve, wherein an inversion traditionally indicates a recession on the horizon – with a mixed track record of reliability.Nomura defines the lifetime of a credit cycle as a decade-long process beginning with the end of a prior financial crisis and a cyclical bottom that ends when credit contracts and the economy enters into a recession.As shown in the report’s intricate chart above, the global economy today is within the range of what Nomura calls the “credit expansion/last stage,” just starting to plateau before it rolls over.The most recent expansion in the US began in June 2009, Nomura writes at the start of the chart, and entered into its “credit expansion/ middle stage” in December 2015 – when the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.That marked the “Fed liftoff,” or “second wave” of the middle stage, and launched the US economy into its last stage where investors are seeing a sharp downturn in stocks and the Federal Reserve pulling back from its “quantitative tightening” program.

Sebi plans to move all stock F&O to physical settlement by October,,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has decided to implement mandatory physical settlement for all stock derivatives by October 2019. According to a circular, the new system will be implemented in three phases starting April.The stocks, which are being cash settled currently, shall be ranked in descending order based on average daily market capitalisation of the company during December 2018.The bottom 50 companies featuring the list will be moved to mandatory physical settlement by April 2019, followed by the next 50 bottom companies which will be moved by July 2019. Remaining stocks will be moved to physical settlement by October 2019, Sebi said in the circular.Further, any derivatives introduced on new stocks going forward will be subject to physical settlement right away.The circular comes nearly nine months after the market regulator introduced the concept of mandatory physical settlement for derivatives. In April 2018, the market regulator had issued a circular on review of framework for stocks in derivatives segment which proposed making physical settlement mandatory for all derivatives.Sebi has shifted around 40 stocks to mandatory physical settlement already. Excessive speculative trading by retail investors in the derivatives market had prompted Sebi to change the settlement system.A white-paper published by the market regulator in 2017 had highlighted the excessive volumes in the Indian derivatives compared to the global peers.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:11 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-plans-to-move-all-stock-fo-to-physical-settlement-by-october/articleshow/67343349.cms
Upgrade police R&D wing to think tank," The BPR&D was born on August 28, 1970, to give a new orientation to the Police Research and Advisory Council, which existed until then since 1966. ","The union home ministry is seeking to upscale the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) into a professional think tank like the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), to broaden its contribution to the evolution of the police force in the country. The move is backed by the recommendation of a committee, headed by former union home secretary Madhukar Gupta, on restructuring of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The panel in its interim report said the BPR&D should come up as an “autonomous body”, like the IDSA, and may also include in its scope a “Research Institute for Border Management”. The Border Management Division of the ministry had given the suggestion on research institute to the panel. Based in the national capital, the IDSA is an autonomous, reputed institute which it says does objective research and policy-relevant studies on all aspects of defence and security. Gupta refused to share details of his suggestions when contacted by ET. “I'm afraid I will not be able to comment on the issue. We have completed our work,"" he said. The Internal Security-I Division of the ministry is working on the report. ET was the first to report last February that the ministry had entrusted the Gupta-led committee to “review the organisation, structure and processes” to meet growing internal security challenges. The BPR&D was born on August 28, 1970, to give a new orientation to the Police Research and Advisory Council, which existed until then since 1966. The primary objective of the BPR&D was modernisation of police force and a speedy and systematic study of the problems the khakhi uniform faced. It had an advisory role as well. But, some police officers believe the BPR&D had failed to live up to its charter though it did work on police reforms and training. One of the reasons for this is that IPS officers do not like posting as the director-general of BPR&D because it is considered as a “punishment” assignment within the fraternity, a senior police officer said. In its interim report, the Gupta panel has also made some recommendations which the Foreigners Division is trying to execute.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:14 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/upgrade-police-rd-wing-to-think-tank/articleshow/67343370.cms
"Atiq Ahmed took over Deoria jail, hosted visitors & roughed up people at will","Police investigations have shown that Ahmed managed to get CCTV footage of those three hours deleted from the jail records, a development that has led to suspension of senior jail officials.","New Delhi: Strongman Atiq Ahmed built his fiefdom in Deoria jail over the past 20 months, meeting visitors inside his barrack number seven for as long as he desired and using mobile phones to threaten prime witnesses against him in the murder case of BSP MLA Raju Pal, investigations by UP Police have revealed.The matter got exposed after a businessman was abducted by Ahmed’s men from Lucknow and driven to Deoria jail on December 26, where he was roughed up by Atiq inside his barrack for nearly three hours and forced to sign papers transferring his property to Ahmed.Police investigations have shown that Ahmed managed to get CCTV footage of those three hours deleted from the jail records, a development that has led to suspension of senior jail officials, and a midnight transfer of Ahmed to the Bareilly jail on Monday night.Police have uncovered another case wherein the prime witness in the murder of BSP MLA Raju Pal, Umesh Pal, was threatened earlier this month by Ahmed’s henchmen from jail over phone, prompting an FIR in which Ahmed will now be interrogated.The case is still under trial, nearly 14 years after the murder of the MLA by Ahmed and his men, and CBI is probing it afresh. While Ahmed’s bail was cancelled in the said case last year by the high court, his clout has only grown after contesting as an Independent on the Phulpur Lok Sabha by-poll last year from jail.The BJP government in UP, which wants to cut down Ahmed’s influence, has put him on its radar since it came to power. Ahmed was shifted to Deoria from his hometown Allahabad’s Naini Jail on April 4, 2017, soon after Yogi Adityanath became the Chief Minister of UP. Ahmed, in fact, went to the Allahabad High Court to challenge his transfer but it was rejected. This, however, seems to have been no setback to Ahmed, a former MP, who soon built his clout in Deoria Jail as well. Mobile phones were recovered from his barrack in raids earlier this year too.None of his fellow inmates in Deoria jail were ready to testify against him before the police regarding the December 26 incident.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:15 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/atiq-ahmed-took-over-deoria-jail-hosted-visitors-roughed-up-people-at-will/articleshow/67343274.cms
Quiz time: 6 iconic paintings that fetched millions at art auctions in 2018,A Modigliani painting sold for a record price at an auction in May 2018.,"This year’s auctions may have eye-popping bids, but 2018 already had its own share of record-breaking paintings. Take this quiz to see how well you know the multi-million-dollar art sales.The new year is here, even as the jury’s still out on whether 2018 was good for the art world or not. Last year had its share of record sales, nonetheless. Take a quick quiz to check if you are in step with the key moments when billionaires loosened their purse strings and acquired these masterpieces. Scribbles, Scratches And Other Abstract Pieces Of Art That Made MillionsAutoplay1 of 6World Of AbstractsWho says a scribble or a scratch is worthless? Check out these abstracts which sold for a fortune thanks to their minimalistic allure.Untitled (1970) by Cy TwomblyCost: $70.5 millionWhat seems like chalk scribbles on a slate is actually an oil-based house paint and crayon artwork on canvas by Edwin Parker ‘Cy’ Twombly Jr, which fetched a record price for the artist in Christie’s 2014 sale. Part of Twombly’s ‘blackboard’ paintings, the 1970 artwork is inspired by his stint in Pentagon as a cryptologist. What’s interesting is the way he produced this artwork. He sat on the shoulders of a friend, who kept on walking along the length of the canvas, enabling Twombly to create fluid lines. The painting’s then owner, Audrey Irmas, a philanthropist, parted with the painting to raise funds for her foundation for social justice. Interestingly, Irmas bought the painting for $3.85 million in 1990. (Image: www.christies.com)Green White by Ellsworth KellyCost: $1.65 millionOnce part of the Robert and Jean Shoenberg collection, this 1961 artwork came into the market at Christie’s 2008 sale. Kelly was a camouflage artist during his stint in the army in the 1940s. He was a part of the unit known as ‘the Ghost army’ comprising artists and designers who painted objects that would misdirect enemy soldiers.(Image: www.christies.com)'Orange, Red, Yellow' by Mark Rothko Cost: $86.88 million (including buyer’s premium)The vibrant orange, red and yellow coloured rectangles was part of art collector David Pincus’s estate and was brought to the market by Christie’s in 2012 where its sale set the record for post war/ contemporary art at the time. Rothko’s 1961 work was in Pincus’s possession for four-and-a-half decades. The final bid was double the highest estimate of the artwork.(Image: www.markrothko.org)'Concetto Spaziale, Attese' by Lucio Fontana Cost: $16.2 millionThe 24 sharp vertical tears on a crimson, water-painted seven- foot wide canvas was contested for about a minute and 30 seconds during Sotheby’s 2015 auction. Yet, the painting was sold below the low presale estimate of $15 million. Turns out, Fontana was inspired to paint this artwork watching Red Desert, a 1964 movie created by Michelangelo Antonioni, which won the Golden Lion in that year’s Venice Film Festival. In fact, the inscription on the back of the painting, in Italian, reads, “I returned yesterday from Venice, I saw Antonioni’s film!!!”(Image: www.sothebys.com)    1. ‘Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)’ by David HockneyAt the November 2018 sale of Christie’s, this Hockney painting became the most expensive work of art by a living artist sold at an auction.

In the New York of 1920s, chop suey restaurants served as popular lunch options for the working class.

RBI provides 1-year loan rejig window for MSMEs,"Yielding to a key demand of govt, central bank allows recast of stressed assets with loans of up to Rs 25 cr ","MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has opened a loan-restructuring window for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) for a year, yielding to a key demand of the government that had sought such a facility, which former governor Urjit Patel was reportedly not too keen on.RBI on Tuesday allowed a one-time restructuring of existing loans to MSMEs that are in default but ‘standard’ as on January 1, 2019, without an asset classification downgrade. The restructuring has to be implemented by March 31, 2020. RBI has allowed the scheme for restructuring of stressed assets with credit facilities not exceeding Rs 25 crore as on January 1.  The issue of restructuring of MSME accounts was discussed in the meeting of the central board of RBI on November 19, 2018. Financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar had made a three-hour-long presentation supporting the government’s stance for providing a boost to the MSME sector. The matter was also discussed during RBI’s recent interactions with the banks and other stakeholders. In various meetings, stakeholders have raised concern that funding of MSMEs would take a hit if the issue of liquidity is not addressed.Under the scheme, a provision of 5% in addition to the provisions already held will be made in respect of accounts restructured. RBI asked banks and non-banking finance companies to come up with board-approved policies. This will include the framework for viability assessment of the stressed accounts and monitoring of the restructured accounts regularly.The relief is for a borrowing entity that is GST-registered on the date of implementation of the restructuring. However, it will not apply to MSMEs that are exempt from GST-registration.Lenders were looking for relief in restructuring stressed assets of mid-sized and small SMEs to help them tide over a period of tight liquidity. The MSME sector contributes to nearly a third of the gross domestic product and employs 111 million people, accounting for about 45% of manufacturing output and 40% of total exports, data from RBI showed.Other Steps for MSMEsA large number of MSMEs exist outside of the formal space and face difficulty in accessing credit. RBI has taken several steps such as setting up the trade-receivables discounting system and allowing banks to co-originate loans with non-banking finance companies to facilitate flow of credit to the sector.In its latest report, RBI had said that the trade receivables discounting system (TReDS) — an institutional mechanism to facilitate financing of trade receivables of MSMEs from corporates and other buyers, including government departments and the public sector — has been gaining traction. The three entities that were granted authorisation to set up and operate TReDS collectively registered 1,878 MSMEs, 235 corporates and 57 banks.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:18 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/rbi-provides-1-year-loan-rejig-window-for-msmes/articleshow/67343373.cms

Tensions among farmers in Uttar Pradesh on the rise as stray cows run amok,"Farmers in UP who once took pride in keeping cattle at home, have found them to be their biggest enemies.","It's 4.30 pm on December 26. Despite the cold weather, a group of farmers is guarding the gate of the village secondary school at Saipur, a village situated around 30 km from Aligarh town. The villagers have locked up around 100 stray cattle in the school building.“The village has around 600 bighas of agricultural land on which we are trying to grow wheat,” said Chandra Mohan Singh (55). “More than half the crop has been damaged by stray cattle. This has happened although we guard our farms at night.”This situation which farmers in Saipur are facing is a common tale across all of India’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh. Be it Bahraich or Lakhimpur in east UP, or Urai and Jalaun in Bundelkhand or Mathura, Agra, Aligarh, Meerut, Baghpat and other places in west UP, the state is facing a cow crisis and no one seems to have an answer. Desperate to find a solution, farmers have started locking up the bovines in government buildings such as schools, hospitals and panchayat bhavans across UP.Agri Economy Versus Gau RakshaCattle has been part of the agriculture ecosystem. Over past one year, this ecosystem has been disturbed as farmers who once took pride in keeping cattle at home, have found them to be their biggest enemies. The BJP government under Yogi Aditynath has been very strict on animal slaughter and most of the illegal slaughter houses are shut. In May 2017, the central government came up with an order on Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which restricted the sale of cattle in the market for slaughter. Cow protection groups have also become super active, making it impossible to transport cattle from one place to another.“Earlier, we used to sell the male calf or unproductive cattle such as older cows for around Rs 4,000 to 5,000. Now, we can’t sell them. So, we leave them on the streets,” said Parveen Kumar (48) of Dabathwa village of Meerut district. Kumar said the cost of one animal per month is around `6,000 and it becomes difficult for farmers to maintain it, especially if the cattle is of no use. Farmers also complain of a sharp decline in the price of cattle in the past one year.“A cow which gives 10 litres of milk every day would earlier sell for Rs 40,000-50,000. Today, it is very risky to take cattle from one place to another as you would be asked too many questions and someone might attack you. The price has come down to Rs 15,000- Rs 20,000 for the same cow,” says Vinod Kumar, a farmer from Pathuli village in Meerut.The growing number of stray cattle has also severely affected the farm economy. This is the time of the year when sowing of wheat and potato seeds are at its peak. On an average, there are 50-100 heads of cattle in every village roaming around freely.When AK Sharma, SDM, Iglas, tried to convince village pradhans to have patience on December 26, Haribhan Singh, the pradhan of Bas Sudama, stood up in protest. “In one month’s time, our crop will be finished and we won’t be able to do anything. You are saying that it will take two months for the situation to improve. We don’t have time.” Singh spent Rs 12,000 to sow potato seeds in his three bigha farm.“Despite keeping an eye, a flock of 50 cows crossed my farm and the entire potato seeds were damaged,” he says. “I had to spend money again to sow the seed and put up a wired fence around my farm.” ET spoke to farmers from over a dozen villages and they all estimate the extent of damage to be around 50% of the entire wheat crop in their area.Cow: A Priority or Pressure PointAs per the 19th Live Stock Census of 2012, there are around 10,09,436 stray cattle in Uttar Pradesh. Work on the 20th Live Stock census has started from October 1 this year and the number is expected to grow manifold in the past seven years.“Because of the ban on illegal cow slaughter and farmers opting to leave their cattle on the streets, there has been a significant rise in stray cattle population in the past two years,” says Goudas, who runs two cow shelters in Bundelkhand.As per the UP Gau Seva Aayog, there are 495 registered Gaushalas in UP. At present, most of them house more than their capacity. For example, the Gaushala in Tappal had 400 bovines as of March this year. Currently, the number has reached 2,000. Another cow shelter in Jittara, Aligarh, had 200 cows in the beginning of the year. Currently, it has around 500 cows. The Bodhpura cow shelter in Urai district had 250 cattle in November last year. Today, it has 800 stray cattle. Most of these Gaushalas complain of lack of funds. Agencies “The government offers `30 per day for 70% of the total number of stray cattle in one gaushala,” said Umesh Chandra Pandey, manager of Gopal Gaushala in Meerut which houses 900 cows. “We have applied for government aid in February this year but till now, the money hasn’t come.”Gopal Singh, who manages Tappal Gaushala, said the administration has assured them of help. “We have a daily expenditure of Rs 40,000 for fodder. We can’t sustain for long in the absence of government support.”UP Gau Seva Aayog, at its last meeting on June 19, 2018, had made several suggestions regarding management of stray cattle in the state. One of the important suggestions was to open new Gaushalas in all the districts of the state with a fund of Rs 1.2 crore for each district. Accordingly, in July, the UP Government allocated Rs 1.2 crore each to the 68 districts of the state to build gaushalas. A proposal was also made to build gaushalas in 12 district jails of the state.  The Aayog has one chairman and three members. The chairman Rajeev Gupta’s tenure ended on July 21 this year while the members’ tenure came to an end in September this year. However, the Aayog is currently headless. “Since there was no team and our tenure ended, there was no follow-up of government allocation of money or work being carried out to provide shelter to stray cattle,” said Sandeep Pahal, one of the Aayog members. “Despite the announcement, work didn’t take place which has resulted in a panic situation right now.”  “We have identified a 69-hectare land in Gabhana, Aligarh, where we will be constructing a cow sanctuary. The facility can house 10,000 stray cattle,” said Chandra Bhushan Singh, DM, Aligarh. “Another such facility would come up in Kaudiyaganj. We are also in the process of freeing up government lands in all panchayats to make it available for constructing Gaushalas. But all this will take minimum two months’ time.”Protection Versus ManagementWith strict monitoring, illegal slaughtering and stray trading have almost come to a halt. The rise in the number of police cases related to cow protection, slaughtering and trading indicates that police are taking regular action. For example, in Meerut alone, total cow-related registered cases have increased from 69 in 2016 to 71 in 2017 and to 117 in 2018.“In 2017, there were 310 named accused in cow-related cases and all have been arrested,” says Akhilesh Kumar, SSP, Meerut.“This year there were 454 accused, out of which 430 have been arrested, and one has died in a police encounter. 89 arrests have been made under the Gangster Act and 28 under the Gunda Act.”Managing the cow menace is proving an uphill task for the district administration across the state. “Every morning I receive complaints that farmers in certain villages have locked up stray cattle in schools and action starts from morning till late evening,” said Chandra Bhushan Singh, DM Aligarh.The DM passes on the message to the SDMs who take the help of the local police stations to rescue the bovines from schools. Next, the rescued cattle are transported to the nearest Gaushalas. “It’s a huge challenge to transport the stray cattle to the Gaushalas as, in some cases, the Gaushalas are 40-50 km away,” said AK Sharma, SDM, Iglas, in Aligarh. “Even Gaushalas have a limit to house cattle.” A team of veterinary officers are deputed to monitor the health of cows on a regular basis.“We can only offer basic treatment to cows because of the large numbers,” said Chandra Bhan, veterinary officer of Tappal.Political Blame Game BeginsAs the crisis unfolds, a political blame game has started among farmers, the cow vigilante and the opposition parties. The cow vigilante, who are active on the streets, blame the problem on both the administration and the farmers.“The government officers don’t take it seriously and delay action until it reaches a point where farmers get agitated,” said Dharma Bhaiya, district head of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Aligarh, and a known Gau Rakshak of the region. He also complains that despite all the claims, illegal slaughtering still takes place. On one such complaint by Gau Rakshaks, Iglas BJP MLA, Rajveer Diler visited HMA, one of the meat processing licensed units in Aligarh on December 27.“I had received complaints about illegal slaughtering taking place here but on enquiry there was nothing suspicious. Everything was happening as per the norms specified by the government and I am satisfied with the unit,” Diler told ET. “It’s a BJP government and the farmers think they can leave the cows and the government will take care. This is wrong.”Mention a Gau Rakshak and it is enough to agitate a farmer. “All these Gau Rakshaks operate in cities and don’t come to villages,” said Lakshman Singh, former pradhan of Mittholi village in Mathura. “They know that villagers might get into a scuffle with them.”Farmers also get support from opposition parties like the Rashtriya Lok Dal. “It looks like a politically motivated incident. Some RLD leaders are inciting the farmers,” said Chandra Bhushan Singh. Anil Chaudhary, RLD state secretary based in Meerut, denies such allegations. “Rather than blaming it on us, they should come up with a solution. What will farmer do when their hard work is going to waste,” he said.","Jan 02, 2019, 12:41 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tensions-among-farmers-in-uttar-pradesh-on-the-rise-as-stray-cows-run-amok/articleshow/67343354.cms

The tournament organisers had fixed up our accommodation in a bungalow. The moment I walked into the bungalow, I saw the place was crawling with spiders. I immediately picked up my bag and cue sticks, walked down the road and tried to find another place. Luckily, a friend of mine had found a hotel. When I entered the new room, the first thing I checked for was spiders. Better safe than sorry.Travelling solo“My first ever trip alone was back in 1999, when I travelled to London for a tournament. I was 14. The first time can be extremely daunting, but once you ease in with your surroundings and the people you meet, doing it a second time isn’t that difficult.

Major drop in GST collectionGST collection dropped to Rs 94,726 crore in December 2018, lower than Rs 97,637 crore collected in the previous month. Compliance improved during the month as the total number of sales returns or GSTR-3B filed in December stood at 72.44 lakh, as against 69.6 lakh filed in November. Modi says BJP will win 2019 pollsPrime Minister Narendra Modi says BJP is confident of doing well at this year’s general election despite the party’s recent losses in state polls. In an interview with ANI on Tuesday, he said there was no reason for morale to be down. “We are confident and are moving ahead. If there is one party which the country trusts and is connected with the people, it is BJP,” Modi said. Remember, BJP lost power in three key states in December, handing Modi his biggest defeat since he took office in 2014 and boosting the Congress party opposition and its allies ahead of national polls due by May.Trump calls meet on US shutdownThere was some hope of progress on the US government shutdown after President Donald Trump invited Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to a border security briefing.

This is the second straight monthly reduction in rates and the biggest single cut ever. ATF is now less expensive than even non-PDS kerosene in cities like Mumbai. A litre of petrol costs Rs 68.65 in Delhi as compared to Rs 58,060.97 per kl or Rs 58.06 per litre price for ATF. A litre of diesel, comes for Rs 62.66. Oil begins 2019 in positive territoryUS oil began 2019 in positive territory on Wednesday, although the general outlook for the year is weak amid soaring US crude supply and concerns of an economic slowdown. WTI spot crude oil futures CLc1 were trading at $45.86 per barrel at 0024 GMT, up 45 cents, or 1%, from their final close in 2018. International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $54.31 per barrel at 0126 GMT, up 51 cents, or 1% from their final close of 2018.NBFCs more fragile than before: Uday KotakVeteran banker Uday Kotak Tuesday said even though non-bank lenders have received a breather since the crisis late last year, the sector is more ""fragile"" than it was a year ago.

UN adopts India-backed data security resolutions,"The two documents are designed to create the foundation for peaceful global interaction and to prevent war, confrontation and any other aggressive action. ","The United Nations has adopted two resolutions, proposed by Russia and backed by India, on International Information Security (IIS) system, marking progress towards creating the world’s first code of conduct in the digital sphere. This month the UN General Assembly adopted the two resolutions – ‘Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ and ‘Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes’ – and thereby opened a new chapter in the global discussion on international information security.The two documents are designed to create the foundation for peaceful global interaction and to prevent war, confrontation and any other aggressive action. The resolutions were supported by several countries and coauthored by more than 30 countries, but did not get the support of the United States and the European Union members.The first resolution, adopted on December 5, aims to protect the interests of all countries in the sphere of cyber security regardless of their level of technological development and includes a number of innovations, starting with a provisional list of 13 international rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of states in this sphere. The key aim of the second resolution, adopted on December 17, is to launch a broad transparent political discussion on combating information crime and to search for and create responses to one of today’s most pressing challenges. The resolution is aimed at promoting a global consensus and working out concrete and practical approaches to countering cyber crime in the absence of effective international legal instruments. The issue of IIS was first placed on the UN’s agenda in 1998 at Russia's initiative. “It is notable that breakthrough decisions aimed at strengthening IIS have been adopted in the anniversary year of 2018. These decisions aim to protect the interests of all countries in the sphere of cyber security regardless of their level of technological development,” said a statement issued by the Russian foreign ministry.The statement further said, “These are crucial provisions, such as the commitment to use information and communications technology (ICT) exclusively for peaceful purposes, to respect the sovereignty of states in the information space, to cooperate in the fight against the criminal or terrorist use of ICTs, and to prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions.”Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories","Jan 02, 2019, 08:36 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/un-adopts-india-backed-data-security-resolutions/articleshow/67343492.cms

It could be a curious mix of greed and fear on D-Street,"The previous year tested investors, who had to deal with an abrupt reversal of fortunes. ","“You’ve got to know when to hold ’em Know when to fold ’em Know when to walk away Know when to run”Country music buffs might remember these lines from the Kenny Rogers’ 1978 album, The Gambler. In the track, the American singing icon depicted a game of poker as a metaphor for life. Wall Street, known for its constant craving for inspiration and adages, soon took over, analogizing the song’s philosophy to stock market investing. An investor’s loose adaptation of these lines would be: Have a clear idea of when to buy a stock, how long it should be held and when it should be sold.To be sure, 2018 was a challenging period for the markets and with the New Year likely to be trickier, the earthy wisdom behind such proverbs are resonating with investors. In 2019, market participants, deluged by conflicting economic readings, split analyst forecasts and political uncertainties, are wondering how to navigate the tricky waters.The previous year tested investors, who had to deal with an abrupt reversal of fortunes. For over four years, the stock market had an almost uninterrupted bull run. Many stocks — mainly small-caps — soared to levels that were last hit in the peaks of the previous bull rally that ended in early 2008. The good part was investors, who were stuck with illiquid small-cap names, got an opportunity to free themselves of these stocks, probably at a profit. The bad news for those investors still holding them, or those that entered at highs, is that most of these stocks are unlikely to revisit the recent peaks anytime soon.The levels at which these stocks were trading at the start of the year had disaster written all over them. Many seasoned investors recognised it as early as in mid-2017; several of them opted to hang in there, while some others folded up and walked away — probably inspired by Kenny Rogers. It took a while before the collapse finally started in February 2018 that led to many midand small-cap stocks falling between 50 per cent and 70 per cent.By the end of 2018, the stock market appears to have settled down but the zing is missing. The stability in the market is thanks to the continuous flows into equity mutual funds from smaller investors through the now famous SIPs or systematic investment plans — a system that allows investors to put in a fixed sum regularly —which is mechanically finding its way into the markets every month. Equity mutual funds receive almost Rs 8,000 crore through SIPs every month, compared with Rs 6,600 crore last January. But, the energy is missing because many investors with deeper pockets are not returning to the market despite many stocks correcting sharply from the peaks. These individuals are parking a large chunk of their incremental money in debt mutual funds and bonds or looking for short-term trading opportunities. For instance, the covered call strategy — which involves a simultaneous purchase of a stock or stock future and the sale of the stock’s call option — is popular among high networth investors.Although the recent correction has made share valuations cheaper compared to 2016 and 2017, rich investors are hesitant to plough their money back into stocks for the long run at this stage of the market cycle. They are in a cash-preservation mode mainly because of the global uncertainties — primarily, the US. Various commentaries emanating from Wall Street are suggesting a downturn there in 2020 as the US Fed could be forced to raise interest rates to keep inflation under check. The other interpretation is that the American central bank will not wait for the recession to set in and will cut rates much before. But, the fact that the US has not seen a recession for 10 years is keeping investors on the edge.The upcoming events at home, chiefly, the general elections, are making investors rather nervous. Although corporate earnings might finally see a revival this year, investors are not excited in a big way because the growth will not be broad-based and nowhere close to that seen before 2008. Meanwhile, fund managers are recommending a shift in investments from consumer stocks to industrial names, which are cheaply valued but also face the risk of being ‘value traps’.Notwithstanding the uncertainties, few seasoned investors want to pay heed to the last bit of musician Rogers’ advice of running away. They walked away with a portion of the gains in 2017 but did not want to sell lock stock and barrel. The fear of a financial market crash, as in 2008, is lingering in their minds but the reluctance to lose out on the remaining moneymaking opportunities in stocks is forcing them to stay put.

"Got Mrs Gandhi’s contact from father in ’96, claims Michel",The reference to “Mrs Gandhi” by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in its remand application last week caused a major political furore between BJP and Congress. ,"Extradited fugitive Christian Michel has claimed that his father Wolfgang Max Richard Michel passed on his contact persons in India when Michel commenced his “business” in India in 1996. Among others, this included one “Mrs Gandhi”, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The reference to “Mrs Gandhi” by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in its remand application last week caused a major political furore between BJP and Congress. The ED, however, refused to disclose the context in which the reference to “Mrs Gandhi” was made by Michel during custodial interrogation. ET has reliably learnt that the probe agencies, including Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), had grilled Michel about his contacts in India. The alleged middleman in the VVIP chopper deal was also confronted over his father’s references in India.Michel, as first reported by ET on December 11, had claimed that his father knew the late Indira Gandhi, former prime minister of India, who was assassinated in 1984. Michel had gone on to claim that his father was “very close to the Gandhi family.”When asked in the Parliament about who is Wolfgang Max Richard Michel (Michel’s father), he claimed Indira Gandhi replied “she considers him as friend of India.” Presenting this to the court, the CBI sought to peruse records of the Parliament of the year 1982-83.CBI, in its remand application, also claimed that Michel’s father told him that he “knew Indira Gandhi since 1970s and used to meet her.” Michel further revealed that his father was a consultant for Westland Helicopters and helped M/s Westland Helicopters to secure contracts for supply of WG-30 helicopters and MK-42 helicopters to government of India. Significantly, Michel has been described by probe agencies as a “historical consultant” of AgustaWestland helicopters, UK. Michel’s defence lawyer Aljo K Joseph, when contacted, flatly refused to comment saying “I do not have any comments to offer. I will not even utter a word in this case”. However, Michel’s defence lawyer in Dubai had claimed that Michel and his father had personal differences. Michel is currently in custody of ED and will be produced before a special court on Saturday. Last week, the ED claimed that Michel had discreetly slipped a piece of paper seeking guidance from his lawyer Joseph on the follow up questions on “Mrs Gandhi”.Michel, the remand paper read, while shaking hands with Joseph, discreetly slipped a piece of paper, which the lawyer kept in his pocket.After a senior ED official noted this, she confronted Michel and Joseph and discovered that the paper had “the typed form of questions to be asked”. The paper “pertained to a set of questions with regard to follow-up questions on Mrs Gandhi”, read the remand application.Seeking to debar Michel’s lawyer from meeting him during ED’s custody, ED contended “it is clear that there is a conspiracy to shield and/or to tamper with evidence that could be brought forth from the questioning of the accused herein”.Following this, the court restricted the time limit of lawyers to meet Michel to 15 minutes every morning and evening.As first reported by ET, ED is also probing the “modus operandi adopted to influence a German deal” allegedly by Michel and his accomplices.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:45 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/got-mrs-gandhis-contact-from-father-in-96-claims-michel/articleshow/67343559.cms

"One more round, please! Zomato may raise $1b in new financing round",Restaurant discovery & food delivery firm in talks with existing backer Ant Financial & new investors like Primavera to counter rival Swiggy’s war chest. ,"BENGALURU| MUMBAI: The online food delivery war is set to intensify further in 2019, as Gurgaon-based Zomato is in talks to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in a new financing round to counter the recent mega fundraise by rival Swiggy, according to three sources familiar with the development. The food delivery and restaurant discovery platform is in discussions with Chinese private equity major Primavera Capital and existing backer Alibaba’s payments affiliate, Ant Financial, for the new round besides other investors.While the valuation for the new round of financing could not be determined, Zomato was valued at $2 billion when it last mopped up capital in October.“Primavera may invest about $200 million in the upcoming round while the remaining amount could come from Ant Financial. The company is also talking to other investors to syndicate the round,” said one of the sources mentioned above.  Primavera is an investor in Ant Financial as well as the Chinese ecommerce major’s local services unit Koubei, which was recently merged with another Alibaba unit, food delivery platform Ele.me. Primavera has also made several other co-investments along with Ant Financial in KFC owner's spinout Yum China and bike-sharing company Hellobike.A Zomato representative declined to comment on the specifics of new investors, but said “there is a new round that we are talking to potential investors (including Ant Financial) for our new fundraise. This will be at a premium to the last round as the company has more than doubled in size since the last round was finalised.”Ant Financial and Primavera did not reply to email queries from ET on the development. “The easy option for Zomato is to raise the new funds from Ant Financial considering they are now the most influential, deep-pocketed investor on their capitalisation or cap table. But they have been engaging with a set of new investors and looking to close the deal over the next few months,” said a person privy to the discussions.“Talks with Ant Financial’s parent Alibaba has also been ongoing for a very long period along with others like Ctrip, the travel giant from China.”The online food-delivery industry stood out for being the most cash-guzzling and hyper-competitive of ecommerce segments during 2018. The year ended with Swiggy’s gargantuan $1-billion fundraise.“Zomato had not anticipated Swiggy to raise $1 billion, it was more on the lines of $600 million in primary money that they thought would come into the firm. This has made them recalibrate their new financing so that they can continue to fight Swiggy,” the person said on the condition on anonymity. Another source close to the matter said that after receiving around $410 million last year from Ant Financial — which now owns 28% stake in the company — Zomato has been keen to get an outside backer.MONEY GUZZLERSMost analysts said Swiggy tops the market, although Zomato claimed leadership in October with 21 million orders a month. Industry sources estimate that both companies are losing $30-40 million each, on a permonth basis, as they offer discounts to customers and incentives to delivery personnel. They now also face competition from ride-hailing companies Ola and Uber, which are pushing into the market with food delivery platforms of their own.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:58 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/one-more-round-please-zomato-may-raise-1b-in-new-financing-round/articleshow/67343568.cms
Big IT’s dollar revenues may rise 2-3% sequentially in Q3,A weaker domestic currency helps exporters by lifting up realisations.,"ET Intelligence Group: The top five Indian IT companies are expected to report 2-3 per cent sequential growth in dollar-denominated revenue for the December 2018 quarter. Commentary on the digital spends by clients and the trend in transformational deals will be crucial.The third quarter of a fiscal is seasonally weak for Indian software companies due to holidays and budget revisions by global clients.The rupee’s depreciation should help the realisations whereas crosscurrency effects may partially offset this benefit.

View Stock Analysis »A weaker domestic currency helps exporters by lifting up realisations. However, other major currencies including the pound and the euro depreciated by 1.4 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively against the dollar during the period.  Since revenue in these currencies is first converted into dollars and then into rupees for accounting purposes, the cross-currency weakness is expected to partially offset the benefit of weaker rupee. The top IT companies earn nearly one-third revenue in currencies other than the dollar.“In light of the dollar’s appreciation vis-à-vis global currencies, we yet again anticipate cross-currency headwinds of 40–60bps for the top-five Indian IT players,” mentioned Edelweiss Securities in a report.According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, the top five IT companies are expected to report 4.1 per cent sequential growth in the rupee denominated revenue for the third quarter. Net profit will grow by 4.5 per cent.The sample includes Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro and Tech Mahindra.Among the sample companies, TCS is likely to report the fastest growth of 4.4 per cent in rupee revenue at Rs 38,491.9 crore. Its net profit is expected to grow at a similar rate to Rs 8,264.3 crore.The operating profitability of the sample companies may improve following weaker rupee.“We expect margins at the top-five IT companies to expand 70–100 bps (basis points, 100 bps equals 1 percentage point) driven by rupee depreciation and operational efficiencies,” Edelweiss said.","Jan 02, 2019, 08:52 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/big-its-dollar-revenues-may-rise-2-3-sequentially-in-q3/articleshow/67343654.cms

US fires tear gas across Mexico border to stop migrants,"Many of the migrants are waiting in Tijuana for a chance to apply for asylum in the U.S., but there was a backlog before the caravan's arrival and the wait is expected to be many months.","US authorities fired tear gas into Mexico during the first hours of the new year to repel about 150 migrants who tried to breach the border fence in Tijuana. US Customs and Border Protection said in a statement later Tuesday that the gas was used to target rock throwers apart from the migrants who were trying to cross.  ""No agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away,"" the statement said.  An Associated Press photographer saw at least three volleys of gas launched onto the Mexican side of the border near Tijuana's beach that affected the migrants, including women and children, as well as journalists.  The AP saw rocks thrown only after U.S. agents fired the tear gas. The agency said agents saw ""toddler sized children"" being passed over concertina wire with difficulty. It said its agents could not assist the children because of the rocks being thrown. Agents responded with smoke, pepper spray and tear gas, it said. The AP journalist also saw plastic pellets fired by US agents.  The agency said 25 migrants were detained while others crawled back into Mexico through a hole under the fence.  Customs and Border Protection said that under its use of force policy the incident would be reviewed by its Office of Professional Responsibility.  Migrants who spoke with AP said they arrived in Tijuana last month with the caravan from Honduras.  The caravan, which left Honduras in mid-October, grew to more than 6,000 members during its month-and-a-half trek north. It has been a constant target of President Donald Trump, who referred to it frequently in the run-up to US mid-term elections in November.  Many of the migrants are waiting in Tijuana for a chance to apply for asylum in the U.S., but there was a backlog before the caravan's arrival and the wait is expected to be many months. Others have found jobs in Mexico and tried to settle there.  In a previous incident, US agents launched tear gas across the border after some migrants tried to breach the border following a peaceful march in Tijuana on November 26. Hundreds of migrants who were downwind of the gas were affected.  Trump is currently locked in a fight with congressional Democrats over funding for the border wall that he wants to build. The stalemate has led to a partial government shutdown.

The funny bone: Michelle Obama wanted 'Becoming' to entertain while being serious,"The former First Lady likes books that entertain, even when they tackle serious subjects.","Michelle Obama reads a lot when she travels and when she is on a holiday.

"After mixed 2018, Mamata Didi eyes the Kingmaker role",The Bengal CM congratulated KCR on his victory though the latter chose to vote against the no-confidence motion brought in by Naidu in Parliament.,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had a mixed 2018, with her rise in national politics being blunted to a certain extent by the rise of BJP in her state. With most regional parties being marginalised after BJP’s victory in 2014, Banerjee bucked the trend, and grew in stature.Post demonetisation, Banerjee has emerged as the most vocal critic of Prime Minister Modi, and has been at the forefront of an Opposition alliance. She could also be the kingmaker in 2019 if either the BJP-led NDA, or the Congress-led UPA, fail to get a majority.Professor Ranabir Samaddar of Calcutta Research Group described that the upcoming 2019 elections could be a prime time for regional parties. Pointing out that there are very little chances of a repeat of 2014, he said, “Banerjee is surely a force to reckon with, but her chances depend on the performance of Congress to large extent. She is strong in one state, but in the overall scenario, the results in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh are very crucial. Political posturing will be clear post poll. But as far as 2018 is concerned, Banerjee has repositioned herself in national politics.” From travelling to Delhi to meet Opposition leaders to supporting JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy in Karnataka to advising Akhilesh Yadav to ally with bitter rival Mayawati in the UP bypolls, Banerjee has played a crucial role in Opposition unity. And if sources are to be believed, she was the one who convinced the JDS to jointly stake claim with the Congress in Karnataka after the BJP landed just short of a majority there. Subsequently, aspiring kingmakers N Chandrababu Naidu and K Chandrashekar Rao both tried to enlist her support. While Naidu spoke of an anti-BJP Opposition front, KCR, in both of his meetings with Banerjee, spoke about a non-Congress, non-BJP alliance. But Banerjee stayed tightlipped. The Bengal CM congratulated KCR on his victory though the latter chose to vote against the noconfidence motion brought in by Naidu in Parliament.Didi certainly isn’t revealing much, and is leaving a lot of room for those who want to speculate. For instance, she attended the swearing-in ceremony in Karnataka where Congress let Kumaraswamy become CM, but was absent in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where Congress had non-BJP parties as minor allies.She is meeting regional leaders, but is yet to hold any meeting with Congress president Rahul Gandhi. In fact, her party promptly expressed its reservation after DMK leader Stalin proposed Gandhi’s name as the Opposition PM’s face. “This is not the time to decide on a name,” was what she had to say. Congress’s string of victories in Hindi heartland prompted her to announce cash schemes for farmers on the last day of 2018.She also carefully planned her political response to the probes into the Ponzi scam allegedly involving senior members of her party. She called the probe a ‘political vendetta’ and termed the agency BBI (BJP Bureau of Investigation). She had called the CBI (Congress Bureau of Investigation) before 2014.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:05 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/after-mixed-2018-mamata-didi-eyes-the-kingmaker-role/articleshow/67343766.cms
"Hyundai scion emerges from father's shadow, says to complete ownership revamp","The target compared with an estimated 7.3 million to 7.4 million vehicle sales last year, the auto conglomerate said, citing analysts' estimates.","SEOUL, - The heir apparent of Hyundai Motor Group said on Wednesday he will complete a restructuring in 2019 as he moves to formally take over from his father at the helm of South Korea's second-biggest conglomerate. Euisun Chung made the comments in his first New Year address to employees in the absence of his 80-year-old father, the clearest sign that he is now in charge of the group as it plans its first leadership transition in about two decades. The transition comes at a difficult time for the group as Hyundai struggles with an extended sales slowdown in the United States and China, a U.S. recall probe, sharp technological change and potential U.S. tariffs. ""Business uncertainties are heightening as the global economy continues to falter. Walls of protectionism are being constructed around the world,"" Chung, 48, told hundreds of employees at the group's headquarters in Seoul. ""Internally, we face challenging tasks such as stabilising business in major markets like the U.S. and China, while simultaneously enhancing our responsiveness to drive future growth."" Group companies Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp earlier announced a ""conservative target"" of 7.6 million vehicle sales in 2019 as they battle to recover market share in China and the United States. The target compared with an estimated 7.3 million to 7.4 million vehicle sales last year, the auto conglomerate said, citing analysts' estimates. The pair will announce 2018 sales results later on Wednesday. Analysts said 2018 was likely the fourth consecutive year the pair had missed their annual sales target, as their latest sport utility vehicles failed to gain traction in China and the United States, the world's two biggest auto markets. NEW MODELS Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors will launch a combined 13 new or face-lifted models this year, including a premium Genesis SUV, Chung said. Hyundai also would launch a pilot service of its autonomous robo-taxi in South Korea by 2021 and explore partnerships with global industry leaders to develop autonomous driving technologies. The group aimed to sell 1.67 million eco-friendly vehicles involving 44 models annually by 2025. Chung was promoted in September to executive vice chairman of the conglomerate founded by his grandfather in 1967, bringing him a step closer to taking over from his father, Mong-Koo Chung, and easing concern about a leadership vacuum. In his New Year's comments, he pledged to ""actively communicate with"" shareholders and enhance shareholder value, an apparent reference to U.S. hedge fund Elliott which effectively scuttled a previous restructuring plan last year.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:05 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/hyundai-scion-emerges-from-fathers-shadow-says-to-complete-ownership-revamp/articleshow/67343806.cms
Two women below 50 enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple; 'purification' ritual held,"Two women — Bindu and Kanakadurga — who tried to reach the shrine last week, told a local news channel that they had darshan on Wednesday at 3.30 am.","Two women in their 40s entered the Lord Ayyappa temple in Kerala early Wednesday, becoming the first to do so since the Supreme Court ended the ban on women of menstrual age praying at the shrine. PTI quoted Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of confirming the news, saying ""it is a fact that the women have entered the temple"".CM Vijayan also confirmed that the two women were provided police protection during their trek to the hill-top shrine.Following the entry of two women at the temple, the chief priest closed the sanctum sanctorum in order to perform the 'purification' ceremony. Reports said the temple was reopened an hour later after the ritual. Despite the Supreme Court's historic ruling on September 28 last year, permitting women in the 10-50 age group, no children or young women in the 'barred' group were able to offer prayers at the shrine following frenzied protests by devotees and right-wing outfits.CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan told media that the two women have entered the shrine as per the apex court order and the closure of the shrine was against the law of the land. ""People should accept the development as a reality,"" he said.The two women travelled to Sabarimala hours after the state-sponsored 620 km-long human wall of women was formed Tuesday from Kasargode in the northern part of the state till the southernmost district of Thiruvananthapuram.The women, identified as Kanakadurga (42) and Bindu (42), wearing the traditional black dress, with their head covered, climbed the hill after midnight under police cover and prayed at the shrine around 3.30 am.""We skipped the 18 steps due to security reasons and used the VIP entry for darshan. There were good number of devotees. So we couldn’t spent much time inside the temple,"" TOI quoted Bindu as saying.Police have provided security to the homes of the two women fearing possible protests.On December 24 last year, the two women had unsuccessfully tried to offer prayers at the shrine.The Lord Ayyappa temple had opened for the 22-day ""Makaravilakku"" festival on December 30, three days after the conclusion of the 41-day ""mandala puja"".Following the top court verdict allowing women of all ages to offer prayers at the shrine, the CPI(M)-led LDF government had decided to implement the verdict, which was strongly opposed by the main opposition Congress and the BJP.Bindu, a college lecturer and CPI(ML) activist from Kozhikode district's Koyilandy, and Kanakadurga, a civil supplies employee from Angadipuram in Malappuram, had come to Sabarimala on December 24 last year after 11 women activists of a Chennai-based outfit were prevented from reaching the shrine and chased away by devotees chanting Ayyappa mantras.","Jan 02, 2019, 01:48 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/two-women-below-50-claim-they-entered-keralas-sabarimala-temple/articleshow/67343872.cms
Indian-origin Singapore student wins gold medals at World Memory Championships,"Dhruv Manoj won in the ""names and faces"" and ""random words"" disciplines, beating 56 other contestants in the ""kids category"" in the competition held from December 20-22. ","A 12-year-old Indian-origin student from Singapore has bagged two gold medals at the World Memory Championships held in Hong Kong.  Dhruv Manoj won in the ""names and faces"" and ""random words"" disciplines, beating 56 other contestants in the ""kids category"" in the competition held from December 20-22.  Dhruv, who just finished primary school, memorised more than seven decks of shuffled cards in an hour; 1,155 binary numbers in half that time; and 87 names and faces in 15 minutes.  The only Singaporean in the competition of over 260 contestants from China, Russia, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, Dhruv stood out with his stupendous memory.  Dhruv has mastered the Roman memory technique of creating ""memory palaces"", which works by associating the ideas or objects to be memorised with scenes imagined at familiar locations, such as one's house.  Training for Hong Kong competition was tougher for Dhruv, who was also a head prefect, a sprinter in the track and field team and a member of the computer club.  Dhruv said he would squeeze in two to three hours of practice a week before the vital Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) after six years of first level of schooling.  He only began intensive training in October, memorising binary numbers and cards for about four to six hours a day.  ""The toughest part was concentrating on what I have to do, because for most of my friends, PSLE just ended... For me, sitting down there and practising... it was hard, but I managed to pull through,"" Singapore tabloid 'Today' quoted Dhruv as saying on Sunday.  Dhruv's father Manoj Prabhakar, who is a management consultant in the oil and gas industry, said: ""I found that Dhruv enjoyed doing it and he's doing pretty well, so I thought I should support him.""

Donald Trump invites Congressional leaders to end govt shutdown,"The partial government shutdown that started on Dec 22 has affected 800,000 federal employees, who have either been furloughed or are working without pay.","By Lalit K Jha Seeking an end to over 10-day partial government shutdown, US President Donald Trump has invited top Republican and Democratic leaders from Congress for a briefing on border security at the White House Wednesday. The partial government shutdown that started on December 22 has affected 800,000 federal employees, who have either been furloughed or are working without pay. Trump himself cancelled the planned trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to spend time with his family for Christmas and New Year. On Tuesday, the first day of the New Year, the White House initiated the lead to end government shutdown over the funding for a border wall, which Trump believes would end entry of illegal immigrants into the US. The move comes as lawmakers started arriving in Washington DC after Christmas holidays. The new Congress, in which the opposition Democrats enjoy a majority in the House of Representatives, begins January 3. ""Border Security and the Wall ""thing"" and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal?"" Trump said in a tweet Tuesday after the White House invited top Democratic and Republican leadership for a briefing on border security. Early in the day, Trump accused the Democrats of not being interested in border security. ""One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!"" he said. Meanwhile, Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter said on the first day of the new Congress, the Democrats will take action to end what she described as the ""Trump Shutdown"". ""As we pass strong, bipartisan legislation to reopen government, which has already received strong bipartisan support in the Senate,"" she said. House Appropriations Committee Chair Nita Lowey filed the legislation this week. ""The package contains two bills,"" she said. One consists of six bills already approved by the Republicans in the Senate, which would reopen all government agencies except for the Department of Homeland Security with full fiscal-year funding until September 30. ""The second bill would extend the Department of Homeland Security's funding through February 8th, which is the date the Senate voted for unanimously. It is important to note that these bills contain no new wall funding,"" she said. But Trump insisted that he is unlikely to move forward without funding for a border wall. ""I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast!"" Trump said in a tweet on December 31.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:19 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/donald-trump-invites-congressional-leaders-to-end-govt-shutdown/articleshow/67343976.cms
NASA space probe 'phones home' in landmark mission to solar system's edge,"Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on its 4 billion-mile journey toward the solar system's edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons.","NASA's New Horizons explorer successfully ""phoned home"" on Tuesday after a journey to the most distant world ever explored by humankind, a frozen rock at the edge of the solar system that scientists hope will uncover secrets to its creation. The nuclear-powered space probe has traveled 4 billion miles (6.4 billion km) to come within 2,200 miles (3,540 km) of Ultima Thule, an apparently peanut-shaped, 20-mile-long (32-km-long) space rock in the uncharted heart of the Kuiper Belt. The belt is a ring of icy celestial bodies just outside Neptune's orbit. Engineers at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland cheered when the spacecraft's first signals came through the National Aeronautic and Space Agency's Deep Space Network at 10:28 a.m. EST (1528 GMT). ""We have a healthy spacecraft,"" Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman declared. The spacecraft will ping back more detailed images and data from Thule in the coming days, NASA said. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on its 4 billion-mile journey toward the solar system's edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. ""Last night, overnght, the United States spacecraft New Horizons conducted the farthest exploration in the history of humankind, and did so spectacularly,"" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern told a news conference at the Johns Hopkins facility in Laurel, Maryland. An image of Thule, sent overnight and barely more detailed than previous images, deepens the mystery of whether Thule is a single rock shaped like an asymmetrical peanut or actually two rocks orbiting each other, ""blurred together because of their proximity,"" Stern said. During a 2015 fly-by, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed methane-rich dunes on the icy dwarf planet's surface. Now 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km) beyond Pluto for its second mission into the Kuiper Belt, New Horizons will study the makeup of Ultima Thule's atmosphere and terrain in a months-long study to seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets. Scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched, according to NASA, making the mission unique in that respect. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and the following year selected it for New Horizon's extended mission. As the probe flies 2,200 miles (3,540 km) above Thule's surface, scientists hope it will detect the chemical composition of its atmosphere and terrain in what NASA says will be the closest observation of a body so remote. ""We are straining the capabilities of this spacecraft, and by tomorrow we'll know how we did,"" Stern told reporters on Monday. ""There are no second chances for New Horizons."" While the mission marks the farthest close encounter of an object within our solar system, NASA's Voyager 1 and 2, a pair of deep-space probes launched in 1977, have reached greater distances on a mission to survey extrasolar bodies. Both probes are still operational.

"HP Envy x360 review: Ideal for those who want a lightweight, compact, convertible laptop",Envy is for anyone who wants a lightweight device without sacrificing power.,"Price: Rs 60,990Rating: ****Specifications: 13.3-inch IPS LCD touchscreen (1920 x 1080 pixels), AMD Ryzen 3/Ryzen 5 processor, 4/8GB RAM, 128/256GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega Graphics, USB Type-C, 2 x USB 3.0 ports, 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo, microSD card reader, HD IR camera, quad speakers, 4-cell battery, Windows 10, 1.3kgPros: Sleek, smart & lightweight design, bright touchscreen display, great performance, loud audio output, HP Active Pen included in price.Cons: Uses proprietary charger, battery life not great, loads of bloatware preloaded.HP typically positions its Envy range of laptops in the premium range, typically around a lakh of Rupees. Envy is for anyone who wants a lightweight device without sacrificing power. With the latest Envy x360, HP is offering AMD’s Ryzen processor for the first time on a convertible laptop.You can choose from an AMD Ryzen 3 or Ryzen 5 in India. Our review unit was powered by the Ryzen 5 and had 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and Radeon Vega 8 graphics — this configuration was priced at Rs 77,990. The Ryzen 3 variant has 4GB RAM, 128GB storage and Radeon Vega 6 graphics. We used it as a primary machine for over 10 days and came to the conclusion that the Ryzen 5 is a solid performer.There were no issues with 4K videos, editing photos in Lightroom and even games like Counter Strike:Condition Zero. This is good enough for most users in our opinion, whatever your use case. We did notice that after heavy usage for more than half an hour, it got considerably hot. It’s not meant to be a high-performance laptop, so this is where the kinks start showing. Battery life is our main disappointment with this laptop. We have seen slim and lightweight laptops deliver fantastic battery backup, but the HP Envy x360 manages just over 6 hours. IFA 2018 Highlights: 5 Laptops That Stole The ShowAutoplay1 of 5Zen-Tastic SeriesAsus has been popular for its ZenBook series of laptops. At IFA 2018, three laptops under the ZenBook S series were launched. Termed as one of the most compact series of laptops, these are meant for general use. All of these are embedded with the ErgoLift hinge, IB webcams, biometric login and more. Another special feature is the touchpad which can double as a numeric keypad. The price is not out yet, but the Asus ZenBooK 13, 14 and 15 under the S series are totally worth the shot. (Image: www.asus.com)2-in-1 Is The New CoolDell's love for webcam-on-the-chin concept in its laptops has been on for quite some time now. However, the new Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 unveiled at IFA, is different. It packs both the trademark InfnityEdge thin bezels and a camera which sits on the chin. It is priced at $879 and will roll out with the next line-up after October 2.(Image: www.dell.com)Swift And Sophisticated	After the world’s lightest laptop (Acer Swift 7), the company is back with another one.		This time it's the world’s lightest 15-inch laptop, Acer Swift 5. A magnesium-lithium cover gives it the lightness Acer’s laptops are known for. In terms of technology, it packs the 2018-stature technology that you’d expect. Starting sales from January 2019, the laptop can be procured for $1099.	(Image: www.acer.com) Wild And Wacky Predator	Acer introduced another cool, wild and wacky gaming laptop. The Predator Triton 900 is a 2-in-1 gaming laptop.		With 360 degree movement, touchpad on the right of the keyboard, it aims at providing the perfect gaming experience. The price of this piece is yet to be rolled out.	(Image: www.acer.com)It's Got The Power	Lenovo’s 2-in-one concept has been refined with the Yoga Book c930. Sharper, bigger screens and a more powerful processor is what this device has to offer. Going past the looks, the technology embedded in this device is more versatile. It will hit the stores in October this year. The price of this masterpiece has not been revealed yet, so fingers crossed.	(Image: www.lenovo.com) This means that you would have to carry the charger with you at every time. One good thing is that the laptop charger does fast charge — we got around 50% charge with 1 hour of charging. The other letdown is that even though this is a premium laptop, HP still offers a proprietary charger on it and not a USB Type-C charger.As for the form factor, the Envy x360 is a convertible with a screen that goes 360 degrees around. What we loved about it in particular is the sleek and lightweight (1.3kg) design despite having an all-metal body. The construction feels sturdy and the tapered design makes it easy to carry around in closed or in tablet mode. On the right side, you’ll see volume buttons, a USB 3.0 port and USB Type-C port while the left side has another USB 3.0 port, 3.5mm audio jack, power button and microSD card reader. The chiclet style backlit keyboard feels comfortable while the multi-touch track pad is responsive. A fingerprint scanner would have been a welcome addition but there is no option for that. The area above the keyboard is where the speakers sit, and this quad speaker setup has been tuned by Bang & Olufsen. The sound is loud and good enough for movies and music. The display is where the Envy x360 really impresses. The 13.3-inch screen is vibrant, has full HD resolution and is bright enough for work during outdoor travel. It has sleek bezels on the sides which HP calls the micro-edge display. Thanks to the slimmer bezels, it is about as large as a 12-inch laptop.The touchscreen responds well and as an added bonus, a pressure-sensitive stylus is included in the box. This is useful if you like to draw, sketch or annotate. The IR assisted web camera works well for Windows Hello login. You need to set it up properly and once you do, it works great. Overall, the screen is great for all type of use be it video, photos, web or documents. On the software side, you get Windows 10 Home with Windows Ink to use with the stylus. Our main issue is with the pre-              loaded bloatware which just consumes storage space. It would be great if HP offered the option of choosing which additional apps one wants during the initial setup.Despite the bloatware issue, the Envy x360 is one of the best options if you want a lightweight convertible laptop. An alternative in this category (and direct competition) is the Lenovo Yoga 530. It offers a 14-inch touchscreen with 8th generation Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD with a fingerprint scanner for Rs 69,999. However, the Yoga is heavier (1.67kg) and does not come with a stylus.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:50 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/hp-envy-x360-review-ideal-for-those-who-want-a-lightweight-compact-convertible-laptop/articleshow/67343945.cms
Slow upward movement in average GST collection puts govt in wait mode,The slight dip in the December numbers over the previous two months can play on government's mind to move critical items like cement and auto parts out of the 28 per cent tax slab.,"GST collection dropped to Rs 94,726 crore in December raising worries over government revenues taking a hit and further delaying rationalising of GST slabs. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had hinted at a single rate structure for the GST regime in the future based on improved tax compliance and increased tax base. The slight dip in the December numbers over the previous two months can play on government's mind to move critical items like cement and auto parts out of the 28 per cent tax slab.""While the Dec collections are lesser than in Nov and in Oct (where it exceeded Rs 1 lakh crore), overall average collection for 2018-19 has shown marked improvement over 2017-18.

Kerala: 620 km long 'Women's Wall' formed to uphold gender equality,,"In a first, lakhs of women stood should-to-shoulder across the national highways, creating a 620-km-long human 'wall' from the northern end of Kasaragod to the southern tip here on Tuesday as part of a state-sponsored initiative to uphold gender equality.The event comes days after thousands of devotees lit 'Ayyappa Jyothies' (lighting of sacred lamps) and lined up from Hosangadi in Kasargod to Kanyakumari, vowing to protect the age-old customs and traditions of Sabarimala.On Tuesday, women from various walks of life - writers, athletes, actors, politicians and techies, government officials and homemakers - stood across the highways crisscrossing through the 14 districts in the state as the event commenced at 4pm.Expressing solidarity, thousands of men also lined up parallel forming a second human 'wall'.The 'Women's wall' was conceived in the backdrop of frenzied protests witnessed in the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala after the CPI(M)-led LDF government decided to implement the Supreme Court verdict, allowing all women to pray at the Ayyappa shrine.The event is part of an initiative to protect secular values, gender equality and to spread a message against those trying to push society into the dark ages, organisers of the programme said.Before the formal start of the event, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan garlanded the statue of social reformer 'Ayyankali'.CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat and CPI leader Annie Raja also paid floral tributes at the statue.Vijayan had earlier expressed confidence that women, cutting across lines of caste and religion, would join the 'wall' to save Kerala from being ""dragged back into the era of darkness.""CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had earlier said that 50 lakh women were expected to take part in the event.Health minister K K Shylaja led the 'Women's Wall' at Kasaragod and Karat was the last person at the end at Vellayambalam here.School students were given half-day holiday, while universities postponed exams scheduled for Tuesday.The government employees and Technopark employees were allegedly asked to take part in the event, which the main opposition Congress-led UDF dubbed ""caste wall"" and ""wall of contradictions"".The participants began lining up at the designated centres since 3pm. A rehearsal was also held.The 'wall' was formed at 4pm, with participants taking a pledge to uphold gender equality and renaissance values.The campaign was suggested at a meeting called by the LDF government following massive protests by right-wing parties and a section of devotees over the government's decision to implement the September 28 apex court order, allowing women of all ages to offer prayers at Sabarimala.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:32 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/kerala-620-km-long-womens-wall-formed-to-uphold-gender-equality/articleshow/67344127.cms
UP to impose 0.5% ‘gau raksha’ cess to protect stray cattle,,"LUCKNOW: The UP government has introduced a “gau kalyan” (cow welfare) cess, a 0.5% additional levy on excise items, which could include alcohol apart from toll tax, as well as several public sector infrastructure companies, to fund construction and maintenance of cow shelters across the state.The UP cabinet cleared the policy on Tuesday. In the past week, there have been at least three incidents of farmers locking up stray cattle in schools and police stations in the state to protest against the stray cattle menace.The state is staring at a severe stray cattle problem, aggravated after the government cracked down on illegal slaughter houses. After several cases surfaced of people suspected to be smuggling, transporting or consuming cow meat being lynched, ageing cattle are simply being abandoned across the state. In rural UP, farmers have reported massive losses after cattle strayed into farm land and destroyed crops while cattle along roads have led to several accidents.  The new cess may raise alcohol prices in UP. The excise department will soon decide which items will be included in the cess. A senior official said the cess will start being levied from this week itself.Excise minister Jai Pratap Singh said he was against including alcohol under the new cess. “I’m not in favour of having this cess on alcohol as it will lead to illegal sales. A meeting will be held very soon to discuss which items could be covered under the cess,” Singh told TOI.  A cess of 0.5% will be levied on toll tax collected by government agencies such as the UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), and on profits made by public sector enterprises and construction agencies such as UP State Construction and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited, UP State Bridge Corporation Ltd, UPSIDC etc. Mandi parishads, which contribute 1% of their income for gau saurakshan (cow protection), will increase this amount to 2%.Under the new policy, temporary cow shelters will be constructed in each rural and urban local body, down to the nagar nigams. Each district is to have capacity for a minimum of 1,000 cattle.The state animal husbandry department will supervise and their construction will be funded through MNREGA and MLA and MP funds.Those caught abandoning cattle after these shelters are up and running can expect to be penalised with fines. Local police and administration are to ensure cattle for which there is no use are taken to the shelters and those who abandon cattle are fined.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:46 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/up-to-impose-0-5-gau-raksha-cess-to-protect-stray-cattle/articleshow/67344143.cms
"China's Didi launches credit, crowdfunding services in diversification push","The new products were tested in 10 cities and have now been introduced nationwide, the firm said on Wednesday.","BEIJING: China's Didi Chuxing has launched a suite of financial products, including crowdfunding and lending, as it continues to diversify outside the ride-hailing business following a year of safety scandals. The move comes on the heels of a company-wide reorganisation announced in December, which was aimed at improving safety on its platform as well as operating efficiency.  The new products were tested in 10 cities and have now been introduced nationwide, the firm said on Wednesday. They include wealth management, credit and lending and crowd-funding for critical illnesses, all aimed at short-term, temporary workers. The products bring Didi into competition with investor Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and technology peer Tencent Holdings Ltd. They also come as rivals including other Alibaba-backed firms have been making a renewed push in a ride-hailing market dominated by Didi, aiming to tap unmet demand brought about by regulatory change. Didi itself is facing new rules and increased scrutiny from authorities after a series of high-profile safety incidents, including the murders of two female Didi passengers in separate cases. As part of a subsequent national audit of ride-hailing firms, the Ministry of Transport said Didi was ""out-of-control"", and pledged to tighten driver recruitment standards. The firm is already short of drivers in major cities, since regulations in 2017 curbed the number of eligible applicants.  Didi, whose backers include U.S. peer Uber Technologies Inc, Apple Inc and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, is reshuffling its domestic business as it expands globally with new services in South America and Australia.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:37 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/chinas-didi-launches-credit-crowdfunding-services-in-diversification-push/articleshow/67344179.cms
"When Amazon, Pepsi & other brands courted controversies, got into trouble for being insensitive","Late last year, luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana stirred up controversy with its promotional videos.","Late last year, luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana stirred up controversy with its promotional videos. Offensive to the Chinese, the videos were deemed racist. Here is a look at five other times that brands got into trouble because of their insensitive choices.1. AmazonIn January, the e-retailer giant got into trouble because of their range of baby clothes, mugs and bags with the slogan ‘Slavery gets sh*t done’ and an image of the pyramids. They were listed by third party sellers on Amazon’s UK website. The products were taken off from the website after inviting the wrath of shoppers and activists, who used the incident to throw light on modern day slavery in certain parts of the world. .@amazon how lovely is this?

H&MThe fashion brand kicked off 2018 by inviting a lot of criticism after an image of a black child wearing a hoodie with the slogan ‘coolest monkey in the jungle’ surfaced on its online store. After much criticism from shoppers, including The Weeknd, the shirt was pulled off the US site. “We are deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print,” the company said in a statement. “Therefore, we have not only removed the image from our channels, but also the garment from our product offering globally.” woke up this morning shocked and embarrassed by this photo. i’m deeply offended and will not be working with @hm an… https://t.co/684367Ox9k— The Weeknd (@theweeknd) 1515439241000 3. DoveIn October 2017, beauty brand Dove missed the mark by a mile with its insensitive commercial featuring a black woman in a brown shirt, taking her shirt off, to turn in a white woman with a light shirt. This commercial played into the trope of associating black with dirty and white with purity. The outcry against the commercial was swift. A spokeswoman for Dove said that the commercial “was intended to convey that Dove Body Wash is for every woman and be a celebration of diversity, but we got it wrong and, as a result, offended many people”. Dove apologised for 'racist' Facebook advert showing a black woman turning white after using @Dove lotion. https://t.co/NGXyhnGuBZ— Habeeb Akande (@Habeeb_Akande) 1507454761000 4. NiveaIn April 2017, Nivea sparked controversy with their advertisement that featured ‘white is purity’ slogan. The skincare brand apologised for the insensitive commercial, claiming that “diversity and equal opportunity are crucial values of Nivea” in a statement. But the incident was reminiscent of the brand’s 2011 controversy, which featured a chic black male clutching the afro of a mannequin’s head with the tagline ‘re-civilize yourself’. Nivea had apologised then and called the advertisement ‘insensitive and inappropriate’. The ad exec at Pepsi got fired & Nivea snatched him up real quick. https://t.co/vQZFT9gGbT— David Hughes (@david8hughes) 1491485488000 5. PepsiIn April 2017, a Pepsi commercial featuring Kendall Jenner spurred heavy criticism for being tone-deaf and insensitive. The commercial featured attractive young people with generic protest signs laughing and high-fiving. In its climactic scene, a police officer accepts a Pepsi can from Jenner, while everyone around grins and applauds. Activists criticised Pepsi for trivialising on-ground reality while misrepresenting police brutality faced by protesters. “No one is finding joy from Pepsi at a protest,” said Elle Hearns, a former organiser of Black Lives Matter. From Marc Faber To John Schnatter, Top Bosses Who Were Sacked For Being Racially OffensiveAutoplay1 of 6Racing To The ExitRecently, several top executives in global companies have had to face the music for being racially offensive.Here are some who had to pay for their words or actions with their jobs.(Text: Rashmi Menon)John Schnatter, Papa John’s Pizza The US pizza tycoon and founder of Papa John’s Pizza, was forced to step down from the company he founded, after he hurled racially offensive slurs and spoke insensitively about violence against minorities while on a conference call with a media agency. While he later apologised for his actions, investors weren’t happy with the bad publicity and asked him to step down. However, just days after he left, Schnatter told a news publication that he had made a “mistake” by stepping down and criticised the board for not doing “proper due diligence”.(Image: Reuters)Jonathan Friedland, Netflix A communication officer is usually adept at handling crisis and negative publicity instead of becoming the cause for it. Netflix’s chief communications officer, however, found himself in such a predicament. Friendland, who joined the company in 2011, was pulled up and fired for using racially offensive language during a meeting with colleagues. In an apology before leaving, Friedland said, “Leaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set, and unfortunately, I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy.”(Image: AP)Ulyana Sergeenko, Fashion Designer At the height of Paris Couture Week, Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko and entrepreneur Miroslava Duma found themselves in a PR crisis. Sergeenko came under fire for sending a bouquet of flowers to Duma with the handwritten note, “To my n****s in Paris.” Duma shared the note on Instagram adding a heart emoji to show affection for the designer. To make matters worse, that same evening, a 2012 video of Duma started doing the rounds, in which she is seen making homophobic comments about a blogger and transgender model. Duma has since been removed from her position as a board member at The Tot, a baby fashion label.Marc Faber, Publisher, Boom And Doom Report In the October issue of his newsletter last year, the Swiss investor, who resides in Thailand, was widely criticised for writing, “Thank God white people populated America, and not blacks. Otherwise, the US would look like Zimbabwe…” The comment cost him a seat on the board of three companies. Three other companies too booted him out, while international TV channels, who would give him air time for his expert opinion, distanced themselves.

"RBI’s measure on MSMEs a relief for borrowers, not lenders: Krishnan ASV, SBI Caps","
Just on the back of a circular, I will not turn bullish on all PSU banks, says SBI Caps VP.","As long as it does not vitiate the SME repayment culture, the measure can be welcome, Krishnan ASV, Vice-President, SBI Caps, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: What do you make of the RBI relief move for MSMEs? Is it coming in a little late? This is probably a much needed relief from the policymakers’ narrative. The MSME sector does need some help. And yet coming from the Reserve Bank of India, it seems a little hurried because as you go through the narrative and comments in the Financial Stability Report which was tabled just a day earlier, a lot of these issues are being highlighted where the RBI maintains that some of these issues need a little more investigation before some measures can be announced.  I am sure a lot of groundwork has gone into announcing this. As long as it does not vitiate the SME repayment culture, this can be welcome. Would this make you a little more bullish and sound on PSU banks? Difficult to answer this on one guideline but I am not sure how much of a relief this is for lenders. It is probably a relief for the borrowers. For lenders, there is anyways that additional provision of 5% which the RBI has mentioned in its circular yesterday. So there is a P&L impact even though it is quite marginal. Banks like Federal Bank have always been quite openly classifying these more conservatively than the PSU banks which need a little more help. So just on the back of a circular, I will not turn bullish on all PSU banks.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:42 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/rbis-measure-on-msmes-a-relief-for-borrowers-not-lenders-krishnan-asv-sbi-caps/articleshow/67344231.cms

While the mercury at in Terai and Dooars tea belts in foothills have dipped even lower than 5 Degree Celsius, many high altitude places have gone under thick snow cover. Darjeeling city itself and surrounding areas, known for premium quality tea, also had a day-long snow fall after a decade. According to Indian Meteorological Department, the low temperature is likely to continue for the first half of January.The chill wave has brought delight to the planters not only in the hills but in Terai and Dooars too those put together produce around 325 Million kg of processed tea. Near 25% of India’s national yield. Last year also, the whole region had a favorable post winter first flush yield after witnessing almost the same temperature dynamics in end 2017.“Tea is a chill loving tree. Hence, normal duration of low temperature is good for its health.

"Alexa, what is your India demand? Skill developers",Amazon is leaving no stone unturned to gain the attention of developers and brands with the intent of keeping its market lead over Google Home and Apple’s HomePod.,"BENGALURU: Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa ended 2018 with 40,000 developers in India and 20,000-plus skills as the US retail giant raced to capture the smart speaker market in the country.However, the Jeff Bezos’ company is leaving no stone unturned to gain the attention of developers and companies and retain its lead over Google Home and Apple’s Siri-powered HomePod, which are gaining foothold in the market.Amazon is building up a base of voice developers across the country, especially in the smaller cities and towns, to develop Alexa Skills with a local touch and personalise it for Indian users.   India is the fourth country in which the voice assistant was launched in October 2017, after the US, the UK and Germany.Amazon wants Alexa to be an extension of its product offerings of ecommerce, cloud, music and entertainment.“We want Alexa to be everywhere. We want anybody, through a voice command, to do any task. Alexa’s engineering team builds alarms and shopping lists, but a lot of customer experiences can be built by developers. We don’t want to restrict Alexa skills building to only Amazon,” said Dilip RS, country manager for Alexa Skills, Amazon India.To this end, Amazon has business development teams that connect with companies, teams that nurture the developer ecosystem and solution architects to help developers and companies build skills that can be used with Alexa.For Alexa, India is the second-fastest growing developer market in the world, after the US.The company has explored the country from Hubballi to Chandigarh as it trained developers, held workshops and hackathons and appointed student ambassadors in engineering colleges, including the Indian Institutes of Technology. About half of the registered developers in India are from smaller cities and towns.“In USA, you wouldn’t go to tier 2, 3 cities. In India we have conducted workshops in Hubballi where 350 people turned up for workshop. The scale in India is huge. We go after big brands but one way to win in India is get local. Our focus is to get localised experiences,” said Puneesh Kumar, country manager for Alexa experiences and devices, Amazon India.The developers either make skills for companies or independently work on skills specialised in jokes, riddles, nursery rhymes and recipes that could someday be monetised.For now, Amazon in India does not have a monetisation strategy for Alexa, nor does it have a monetary relationship with third-party developers.Developers say what Amazon is doing with Alexa is what Google has done with Android – make it a playground for voice developers. Apart from evangelising developers, Amazon is approaching companies and digital agencies to help them shape a voice strategy and connect them to preferred developers such as Tata Consultancy Services, Mphasis and Agrahyah Technologies.“Amazon doesn’t wait until the last minute to introduce developers to companies. Amazon is so sales driven. They are evangelising what to build, how to build, why to build. In Amazon, the solutions architect and the sales team are like a couple,” said Sreeraman Thiagarajan, cofounder at Agrahyah Technologies.Amazon wants to make sure that Alexa does not end up becoming just a music-streaming assistant. It wants to get as many useful skills on the platform as possible. Its developer strategy is far more aggressive than Google and Apple in India.","Jan 02, 2019, 09:57 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/alexa-what-is-your-india-demand-skill-developers/articleshow/67344124.cms
India looks to maintain lead in spices this year,"But plantation crops like rubber, coffee and pepper may face a bleak prospect
","KOCHI: Plantation crops such as rubber, coffee and pepper are facing a bleak prospect in 2019 even as India looks to extend its dominance in spices like chilli, cumin (jeera) and turmeric during the year.Rubber production in 2018-19 is likely to fall below the revised target of 6 lakh tonnes set by the Rubber Board as there has been a drop in latex yield even before the lean season in summer. This is attributed to heavy rainfall during monsoon months.International rubber prices are predicted to remain low because of oversupply in 2019. “The rise in price will depend on China, the largest consumer, the trade war between US and China, crude oil prices and the decision of the tripartite council of Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to cut exports,” said Anu Pai, research analyst at Geojit Commodity.Coffee growers said plants have suffered damage from heavy rains last year. “It looks like another bad year for coffee. Last two years, the output dropped because of drought,” said MB Ganapathy, chairman of Karnataka Planters’ Association. He expects the crop to be well short of 3 lakh tonnes. In 2017-18, the production stood at 3.16 lakh tonnes. Global coffee prices have crashed as it was a bumper crop in Brazil, the largest producer.India, the largest producer and exporter of chilli looks to consolidate its position as a normal crop is expected. “There has been a 20 per cent rise in sowing area. But poor monsoon in parts of Andhra and Telangana will limit output. A marginal increase in crop may be there,” said Ravipati Peraiah, MD of Vijayakrishna Spice Farms. Prices are expected to remain steady. India produced 23-24 lakh tonnes of chilli annually in past couple of years.India is expecting a good harvest of cumin, the second largest exported spice. “Political issues in the competing countries will make India the dominant supplier in the global market,’’ said Rajiv Palicha, chairman of All India Spices Exporters Forum.Unlike in the past couple of years, turmeric production will be better in the Tamil Nadu region while it may drop slightly in Andhra and Telangana, the largest producing area, Palicha said.

ULIPs: A holistic risk management tool,,"By RM VishakhaIn the context of financial instruments, the commonly used phrase “having your cake and eating it too” goes well with ULIPs or Unit-Linked Insurance Plans.When we think of risks, we only associate with physical risks (death, disability, critical illness). The risks of market volatility and lack of financial discipline are real, significant, and often, unacknowledged. ULIPs allow for management of all these three risks due to the insurance cover, policy lock-in (to prevent impulse spends from funds put aside for long-term needs) and investment options of automatic profit bookings, fund options and fund switching provisions.The smartphone is perhaps a good anecdotal comparison, to explain how ULIPs extend themselves to multiple objectives of financial planning and risk management. Akin to the smartphone, that incorporates several capabilities into a nifty, handheld device with a built-in camera, utility applications to book cabs, online wallets etc., ULIPs too pack in a host of benefits for its customers.The multifaceted ULIP allows for flexibility of investment, based on return expectations and risk appetite. One can invest in debt or equity — or simply schedule investments to shift between the two, depending on age or return triggers, as per one’s tailored preferences. ULIPs’ in-built aspect is the life insurance cover. The cover is significantly higher than the invested amount in the initial years, to fit individual life goals. Eventually, with a built-up corpus, charges for the life cover are also exempted, making this a cost-efficient proposition.ULIPs, while helping one stay on the financial discipline pathway, gives one the option of withdrawal or adding onto the corpus over the longer term, as well. ULIPs have an in-built agility to cater to evolving needs of a customer through enabling switches between asset classes to book returns, scheduling systematic withdrawals to supplement income, or enhancing investments during earning years for a given future goal. This makes the plan a holistic ‘partner for life’, all through one’s financial journey of accumulation, growth and systematic withdrawals. Further, the convenience is unparalleled with cumbersome documentation or tax implications taken out of the picture when one buys a ULIP.Since there is the aspect of regulated and defined reduction in yield, the value for money element is taken care of. ULIPs coupled with term cover work out cheaper than investing through a mutual fund over the longer term. Besides, an insurance company is inherently wired to maintain its customers’ financial stability, making it one of the more reliable customer investments.While creating plans for life goals, the commitment of the ULIP provider to stay throughout the life of the policy is critical. ULIPs, by virtue of regulation, do not have any call options. That means the plans will be serviced as a promise made for life.It won’t be a stretch to refer to the ULIP as the unacknowledged soldier capable of morphing itself to cater to the needs of simplicity, ease, agility, and as a protector against risks.New Year resolutions revolve around sticking to commitments made towards fulfilling cherished goals and dreams. In tandem with the hard work involved in making a lasting and long-term impact, there is an able and supporting aide in the ULIP, to structure one’s financial plans in a single place while delivering not only value for money, but also peace of mind.(Author is managing director, IndiaFirst Life Insurance)   ","Jan 02, 2019, 10:02 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ulips-a-holistic-risk-management-tool/articleshow/67344390.cms

Wanted! More sportspersons - like Mashrafe Mortaza - to dabble in politics,"After all, legislatures around the world could do with more sporting spirit.","Sports stars taking to politics as a second career after retiring is not unusual. Only in some cases are they passive players; mostly, they put their never-say-die sporting spirit to good use at the hustings and pull off spectacular victories, as demonstrated by Imran Khan’s inexorable ascent to the prime ministership of Pakistan last year. But active sportspersons entering politics is rarer, unlike film stars, lawyers and business tycoons. So, the landslide win for Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh’s serving one-day international (ODI) captain, in the general elections on the last day of 2018 is truly one for the record books. Of course, legendary Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao is a shining example of active sport stars becoming successful politicians, being a serving senator in the Philippines as well as the reigning WBA welterweight champion.MC Mary Kom is India’s similar out-of-the-box(ing rink) success, as a regular Rajya Sabha attendee even as she maintains a stellar record of international medals. Her predecessors have not all been so sporting.With the lack of sporting spirit increasingly evident in legislatures across the world, the entry of more active sportspeople may be beneficial. And the sporting motto politicians should     remember is, “Respect your opponent, because without him or her, there is no game.”","Jan 02, 2019, 01:06 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/more-political-players-may-improve-the-game/articleshow/67344374.cms

Here's how you can claim tax benefit on a top-up home loan,Some of us who want to renovate or repair our homes take a top-up over the home loan due to the long tenure of our mortgage (usually 15-20 years).,"A regular home loan offers various tax benefits. These include a deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh on the principal repayment under section 80C of the income tax Act and up to Rs 2 lakh on the interest paid under section 24 in a single financial year. Now, other than this, did you know there is way you can claim tax benefit on a home loan? Yes, you can claim a tax benefit if you have taken a top-up on your home loan.Some of us who want to renovate or repair our homes take a top-up over the home loan due to the long tenure of the mortgage (usually 15-20 years). Here's a look at what a top-up loan is and the tax benefit you can claim on the loan.What are top-up home loans?A bank usually offers top-up loans to its existing home loan borrowers. According to websites of banks, the interest rate on such loans is usually lesser than what a borrower would have to pay on personal loans. Some banks offer top-up loans that can be used for any purpose like daughter's wedding, a vacation and so on. Others offer these loans that have to be used exclusively for the purpose of repairs and renovations of the house. Tax benefits on top-up home loansPractising Chartered Accountant Sachin Vasudeva says, ""You can claim tax benefit on the top-up loan, provided you have receipts and documents to prove that the top-up home loan taken has been used for acquisition/ construction/repair/renovation of a residential property.""Abhishek Soni, CEO & Founder, Tax2win.in, a tax-filing website says, ""Unlike a normal home loan where maximum deduction available on interest payments is Rs 2 lakh, if the top-up loan has been taken for repairs and alterations, then the maximum deduction available in such regards is of Rs 30,000.""Remember the deduction available on interest will be under the overall limit of Rs 2 lakh. This can be explained with an example below. Suppose, the interest paid by you on the top-up home loan is Rs 32,000. Here, the maximum deduction you can claim is Rs 30,000. If there is any interest payment made on the regular home loan that will be deducted from the balance Rs 1.7 lakh (Rs 2 lakh minus Rs 30,000). Therefore, the total interest deduction on the home loan and top-up will be Rs 2 lakh in a financial year.""However, here one must remember that the limit of Rs 30,000 is available for a self-occupied house only. In case repairs and renovations have been done on a let out property, in that case, there is no limit on the deduction can be claimed. However, maximum set-off that can be claimed in a financial year against other heads of income is Rs 2 lakh. Any interest payments over and above Rs 2 lakh in a financial year will have to be carried forward up to eight years,"" explains Soni.While claiming deduction on the principal repayment, there is a condition that one must remember. Vasudeva says, ""The tax benefit on the principal repayment depends on the usage of the funds. If the funds are used for the construction or purchase of a new property, the principal along with interest will be eligible for deduction subject to the limits provided in section 80C and 24 (b), respectively. However, if the funds are used for the repairs, renovation or alteration of the property, then no deduction can be claimed on the principal repayment."" Dos and don'ts while claiming the deductionYou can claim deduction on the interest part of the payment, even if you have missed the actual payment. This is because section 24 mentions the words ""paid or payable"" is respect of interest payment on housing loans. However, remember to keep the documents safely in case tax authorities ask you for proof.Secondly, the deduction (either on interest payments/principal repayment or both) will be considered eligible only if the loan amount is used for repair, renewals, alterations or purchase/construction of house. If the top up loan is used for any other purpose like children's education, family holiday etc. then no deduction will be available.Lastly, one must keep receipts and documents to prove that the loan taken is used for repair/ renovation of the residential property.","Feb 14, 2020, 01:31 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax/heres-how-you-can-claim-tax-benefit-on-a-top-up-home-loan/articleshow/67320968.cms
"Our exposure to MSME sector closer to Rs 20,000 crore: Ashutosh Khajuria, Federal Bank","
“There has been an acknowledgement of the problems being faced by the MSME sector.” ","As of 31st December, we were already prepared for normal provisioning required for MSME sector, Ashutosh          Khajuria, ED and CFO, Federal Bank, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:  Was the RBI move a big relief indeed for the MSMEs? Yes. A lot of debate and discussion has happened over it and that should not vitiate the repayment culture. As a result, there has been an acknowledgement of the problems being faced by the MSME sector -- right from DeMo to GST implementation. But this relief is being offered only to those who are GST registered and the total credit facilities from all the organised lenders mean the banks and NBFCs put together is less than Rs 25 crore including the non-fund based exposures. I think that is a big relief. It has come immediately after the sunset of the earlier restructuring which ended on 31st December. Otherwise from 1st of January, the 90-days norm would have been applicable for the existing restructured ones and they would have come under the normal standardisation roadmap. On your books, would you quantify the exposure to MSMEs? Also, what were the NPAs as of last quarter? The cut-off had been kept up to Rs 25 crore. Our exposure is closer to Rs 20,000 crore. We have two segments in that – one is the commercial banking which starts from Rs 5 crore and that goes up to Rs 25 crore and below Rs 5 crore, there is business banking. It will be applicable mainly for about Rs 11,000 crore exposure. Our understanding is that there is going to be a relief on the provisioning front. Are there any loans that you have provided for and where you are in a position to reverse them going forward? And is that also going to be captured in your numbers?Details are yet to be received. Unless we get the full guidelines, I would refrain from making any comments but I think as of 31st December, we are already prepared for the normal provisioning required for this sector.","Jan 02, 2019, 10:18 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/our-exposure-to-msme-sector-closer-to-rs-20000-crore-ashutosh-khajuria-federal-bank/articleshow/67344528.cms

Nimble private insurers chip away at LIC’s lead,LIC’s market share by way of adjusted premium equivalent has fallen from 53 per cent in FY16 to 48 per cent in the second half of FY19.,"It is an established business maxim that the incumbent leader sheds its dominance in an industry that ends monopolies by law. LIC of India, which once covered the whole nation against life’s contingencies, has consistently been ceding ground to new rivals in the 18 years New Delhi unshackled the business.On the last day of 2018, the premier insurer had a leadership change, with the chairmanship of VK Sharma coming to an end. During his tenure, the insurance giant lost another 5 per cent market share, putting a question mark on the model of a business that was created on an elaborate — but expensive — network of last-mile agency.In the interim, private life insurers appear to have caught up offering more unlinked insurance products with commission of less than 10 per cent as LIC still relies on high commissions for agents, making its products more expensive. Hence, the erstwhile monopoly needs a revamped business model to wrest the initiative back from the more nimble private sector.LIC’s market share by way of adjusted premium equivalent has fallen from 53 per cent in FY16 to 48 per cent in the second half of FY19, according to data collated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority and the Life Insurance Council.“If you have a market with 24 players, it is not possible for LIC to hold on to 100 per cent market share,” said an LIC executive. “Holding on to 48 per cent market share in itself is a miracle after 18 years of opening up.”LIC had written annualised premium equivalent of Rs 27,800 in FY16, which rose up to Rs 36,000 at the end of 2017-18. In the same period, private sector insurers increased their share from 47 per cent to 52 per cent. This is when SBI Life increased its share from 9 per cent to 12 per cent and ICICI Prudential Life retained its APE market share at 10 per cent in the same period. APE or annualised premium equivalent is a common measure of ascertaining the new business sales in the life insurance industry.“The focus on the annuity business has gone up and so APE comes down,” said Joydeep Roy, partner, PwC. “While top line growth has gone up, it has been losing APE market share over the last five years.”An annuity is an insurance product that provides annual payment to the buyer at regular intervals, usually fixed returns, after retirement. LIC dominates the annuity business with a 95 per cent market share. About 20-25 per cent of LIC’s total new business is annuity. LIC reprices annuity products intermittently, especially when the rates move.Annuity products, by contrast, have huge risks, as they offer high return and cover life risk guarantee. LIC’s market share has come own because LIC was been reducing the returns on annuity products, said the LIC executive quoted above.Companies such as Kotak and Tata AIA are focusing instead on regular premium products. Companies with higher regular income products report higher APE growth.“Sharma had tried to return to the basics of training and building a fresh professional agency, not just depending upon the older batch of agents,” said Roy. “Market share was not the focus, but building agency will show results in the next CMD’s term. He stressed on technology for customer service.”“LIC should be worried about more than the required share of annuity and pension products,” said a former LIC executive. “All corporate pension plans and individuals choose LIC at the time of retirement for high return.”","Jan 02, 2019, 10:24 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/nimble-private-insurers-chip-away-at-lics-lead/articleshow/67346273.cms

Iran to double down on investment in oil's growth engine India,Surging oil demand in India is prompting almost all big global players to devise new plans for the country.,"By Ganesh Nagarajan and Debjit ChakrabortyIran will invest about Rs 1,500 crore to expand a refinery run by Chennai Petroleum Corp., the company’s managing director said, amid U.S. sanctions on the Persian Gulf nation that have severely hit its oil exports.The state-run company is boosting capacity at its Nagapattinam facility by nine-fold to process 9 million tons per year and the investment is Naftiran Intertrade Co.’s share of the Rs 27,500 crore ($4 billion) expansion plan, Managing Director S.N. Pandey said in an interview in Chennai last week. The rest of the investment will be through debt and equity, including fresh capital from its main founder Indian Oil Corp.“We will achieve the financial closure in 2019,” Pandey said. “We don’t see any issue in debt raising. We have already talked to many bankers.”While Naftiran’s investment will ease the Chennai Petroleum’s fund raising task, it will ensure Iran maintains its grip in India, where surging fuel demand has turned it into a prized market for global oil producers. For India, Tehran has been a reliable and cheap source of crude extending favorable credit terms, a key driver for New Delhi to convince Washington to grant some exemption from sanctions that restrict trade with the country.Surging demand in India prompted Russia’s Rosneft Oil Co. PJSC to acquire a private refiner in 2017, while Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. have committed investments in a proposed plant as the nation adds capacities to fulfill fuel consumption needs that are expected to outstrip all other nations in the decades ahead. Naftiran, an affiliate of state-run National Iranian Oil Co. holds 15.4 per cent of Chennai Petroleum, while Indian Oil owns 51.9 per cent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Apart from boosting capacity, Chennai Petroleum is building a petrochemicals plant of about 475,000 tons per annum capacity, Pandey said. The new plants will enable the refiner to process dirtier and cheaper crude, apart from making more value added products. This year, it imported Iraq’s Basrah heavy crude for the first time and is now looking get shipments from the U.S., Pandey said.The detailed feasibility report for the expansion project, that includes the petrochemicals plant, is expected to be ready by June. “Tentatively by December 2022, the whole complex will be ready,” Pandey said.Chennai Petroleum operates a bigger refinery at Manali near the city of Chennai, with capacity to process 10.5 million metric tons of crude annually, or about 210,000 barrels a day.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:31 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/iran-to-double-down-on-investment-in-oils-growth-engine-india/articleshow/67344621.cms
"No more blackouts from April 1, vows power minister",,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: Consumers will get uninterrupted power supply from April 1 and building blocks for this are all in place, according to power minister RK Singh.From this ‘zero date’, state distribution companies (discoms) cannot resort to wilful blackouts to avoid buying power. If they do, they will invite stiff penalty from state regulators, who will also tally area demand with PPAs (power purchase agreements) to see whether the utilities have lined up adequate supplies. Only blackouts due to technical issues or natural calamities will be exempted from penalties.“Electricity is as important as breathing. Everything now runs on power. You shut off electricity, you are putting lives at risk because ICUs, lifts, transportation services and continuous manufacturing process industries are running on it. People are doing away with generators. That’s what we want. Electricity is an essential commodity. You (discoms) can't say, like, the electricity cost has shot up so we will not buy power but resort to load-shedding. I say improve efficiency and assure 24X7 supply,” Singh said.PM Narendra Modi’s promise of 24X7 quality power was one of the big draws for the electorate in 2014 polls. But nearly five years later, the power ministry's dashboard itself shows consumers still facing blackouts, though the average duration has come down drastically.“All that will be a thing of the past from April 1,” Singh said with confidence. “This is not something that we have done on our own. This is something which we (the Centre and the states) have discussed and signed up for (Power for All Document). March 31, 2019 is the deadline i.e. from April 1, 2019 there will have to be 24x7 supply, except for one or two sectors such as agriculture where they do not need 24x7 supply; they need supply when there is a requirement.”Singh is banking on the revised tariff policy containing stringent provisions against wilful blackouts. But will that be enough to make discoms buy power since UDAY, the scheme to restore their financial health by improving key parameters such as losses due to theft and improving billing and recovery, hasn’t yielded the desired results. Singh aims to address these issues through a policy sequel, named UDAY-II, and infusing technology such as smart pre-paid metering regime and helping states to change naked overhead wires into aerially bunched insulated wires to stop ‘hooking’ – a popular method of stealing power.On concerns over discoms’ ability to bill and recover charges from poor households that have been given connections under Saubhagya scheme, Singh said the smart meters will not only do away with human interface for this activity but will also give a flexible payment option to poor and plug revenue leakage.“Pre-paid metering is pro-poor. Right now you are asking the poor person to pay the bill for 30 days at one go. I am saying that a pre-paid meter enables him to pay in 5 instalments, 6 instalments, 10 instalments, 20 instalments. He can pay for two days at a time. If he has Rs 50, he can recharge the amount and enjoy power. Again, if he will not have money he will sort of manage but when he has money he can recharge again. This allows him to pay as per his financial condition. It is also pro-discom because the discom gets the payment in advance,” Singh said.“Now the spread is so huge that discoms don’t have enough manpower to take meter readings. So in rural areas you will find that the meter reading is done once in 3,4 or 6 months. It is not being done and the bill reaches the consumer after three or six or whatever months. So if you give a bill to a consumer for three months at a time, most consumers will find it very difficult to pay. Because of Saubhagya we are adding a huge number of consumers. This outsourcing led to difficulty for the consumers. They received inflated bills because meter readers simply did not go. So I said switch over to smart pre-paid meters and gave a time frame of three years to all states.On UDAY, he said: “Overall, losses have come down at the national level (21.8%). But it is still work in progress. Losses of some states have not come down at the desired trajectory; losses of some states have, in fact, increased. This is something we are addressing at multiple points. One of course is that we are saying in the revised tariff policy that any loss beyond 15% cannot be passed on to the consumers and discom and the state government will have to be bear the burden that is one incentive for reducing losses,” he said.","Jan 02, 2019, 10:38 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/no-more-blackouts-from-april-1-vows-power-minister/articleshow/67344682.cms
"Toxic, misinformation, nomophobia: Words that had the world's attention in 2018","Global Language Monitor (GLM), which tracks top trending words, named 'The Moment' its top word of 2018.","NEW DELHI: Terms such as toxic, misinformation, nomophobia, single-use and justice remained in focus in 2018 and have been adjudged top words of the year by dictionaries.'Toxic' is the Oxford word of the year 2018.""In 2018, toxic added many strings to its poisoned bow becoming an intoxicating descriptor for the year's most talked-about topics. It is the sheer scope of its application, as found by our research, that made 'toxic' the stand-out choice for the word of the year title,"" Oxford Dictionary said.Along with a 45 per cent rise in the number of times it has been looked up on oxforddictionaries.com, over the last year the word toxic has been used in an array of contexts, both in its literal and more metaphorical senses, it said.Merriam-Webster chose 'justice' as the word of the year. It was a top lookup throughout the year at Merriam-Webster.com, with the entry being consulted 74 per cent more than in 2017, it said.""The concept of justice was at the centre of many of our national debates in the past year: racial justice, social justice, criminal justice, economic justice. In any conversation about these topics, the question of just what exactly we mean when we use the term justice is relevant, and part of the discussion,"" the dictionary said. Getty ImagesMerriam-Webster chose 'justice' as the word of the year.  ""Justice has varied meanings that do a lot of work in the language - meanings that range from the technical and legal to the lofty and philosophical. For many reasons and for many meanings, one thing's for sure: justice has been on the minds of many people in 2018,"" it said. TL:DR, Bingeable & Other Tech Words That Made Their Debut In The DictionaryAutoplay1 of 9No WordplayMerriam Webster recently introduced over 840 words to the dictionary, including some that were inspired by today’s digital lifestyle.We list some of the favourite tech-inspired words:(Text: Shannon Tellis)Bingeable When you have thousands of videos available for streaming at your fingertips, it’s hard to stop at just one. Taking the concept of ‘bingeing’ one step further, ‘bingeable’ refers to a product or series that has multiple episodes or parts which can be clubbed together and watched rapidly in quick succession.Force Quit If you have ever dealt with an unresponsive app, you’ll recognise this one. Used as a transitive verb, ‘force quit’ is what you click when you want to shut down an unresponsive computer program by using a series of preset keystrokes.Airplane Mode A handy operating mode for electronic devices (mobile phones or tablets) wherein you cannot connect to wireless networks or send or receive communications (calls or texts) but can use the device for all other functions like reading a book or watching a previouslydownloaded movie. While commonly used during flights, you can also use this mode to intercept pesky pings during important meetings or when you need that beauty sleep.TL:DR An outcome of people messaging abbreviations for quicker clarity, TL:DR signifies ‘too long; didn’t read’ and is used to indicate something that would take too much time to read. It can also be used to indicate a quick summary of a longer text or passage. 'Single-use', a term that describes items whose unchecked proliferation are blamed for damaging the environment and affecting the food chain, was named Collins' word of the year 2018.Single-use refers to products - often plastic - that are 'made to be used once only' before disposal. Images of plastic adrift in the most distant oceans, such as straws, bottles, and bags have led to a global campaign to reduce their use.According to Collins Dictionary, the word has seen a four-fold increase since 2013.Dictionary.com announced 'misinformation' as its top word.""The rampant spread of misinformation poses new challenges for navigating life in 2018. As a dictionary, we believe understanding the concept is vital to identifying misinformation in the wild, and ultimately curbing its impact,"" it said.But what does misinformation mean? Dictionary.com defines it as ""false information that is spread, regardless of whether there is intent to mislead.""'Nomophobia', defined as ""fear or worry at the idea of being without your mobile phone or unable to use it"", was chosen as the word of the year by Cambridge Dictionary.Global Language Monitor (GLM), which tracks top trending words, named 'The Moment' its top word of 2018. It also announced 'weaponize' as the top word of the year for the US alone.""This is the first time GLM's analysis has determined two top words of the year. This is because of the disparity between English-language usage between the US and the rest of the world especially in the language of politics,"" says Paul J J Payack, president and chief word analyst at GLM.""Today, 'The Moment' represents a larger than life experience, the convergence of, perhaps, fame, fortune, and happenstance representing a time of excellence or conspicuousness. More importantly, it can be seen as where we now stand in the evolution of the flow of information,"" he says.""The term 'The Moment' defines a unique confluence of social and media forces where a person is elevated to a perceived pre-eminent position in their fields, situations, or positions.

Jet Airways defaults on loan repayments to banks,The full service carrier has been grappling with financial woes for quite some time now and has been making delayed salary payments to staff. ,"MUMBAI: Lenders to Jet Airways are expected to step up pressure on the airline’s management to recover unpaid dues and raise money through equity or sale of assets after it revealed that it had defaulted on loan repayments for the first time in December.Shares of India’s second biggest airline by market share crashed on Wednesday and ratings agency ICRA downgraded its debt to D from C, a rating usually given to companies in default or which are going to default. “There have been delays in the implementation of the proposed liquidity initiatives by the management, which have aggravated its liquidity,” ICRA said in a statement. “The company has already been delaying its employee salary payments and lease rental payments to the aircraft lessors”Jet’s share price fell on Wednesday closing 6.16% down at Rs 263.75 after the airline informed exchanges about the default late Tuesday night. The airline has debt of more than Rs 8,000 crore on its books. “..the payment of interest and principal instalment due to the consortium of Indian banks (led by State Bank of India) on 31st December 2018 has been delayed due to temporary cash flow mismatch and the company has engaged with them in relation to the same,” Jet said to the exchanges.Bankers are now expected to speed up discussions with the carrier to repay and raise money to resolve the cash-crunch. ""Lenders have already been in discussion with Jet Airways regarding the stress they were facing in terms of liquidity. With this default now that discussion will gather speed. However, the next step can only be ascertained after we know how much stress the airline is actually in. Whether its a short term stress or a sign of a larger default. That we will know only in the days to come,"" said a senior banker from a public sector bank which is a lender to the airline.This is the latest and most serious issue underlying the economic crisis facing Jet. The loss-making, cash strapped airline has delayed salaries, laid off staff, grounded planes and pruned flights.A person close to the development said Jet has failed to pay for the month of December which has put it in the SMA-0 category, which includes loans that are in a default between 1 to 30 days. If Jet defaults beyond 30 days it will go into SMA-1. Defaults between 61 days to 90 days is classified as SMA-2. If dues are not cleared for 90 days, it becomes a non performing asset (NPA) for which banks have to set aside a provision in case of non recovery. According to a circular issued by the RBI on Feb 12 last year as soon as a company defaults payments for even a day, banks have to put the account under watch and undertake steps for recovery. Jet Airways is a borrower from 26 lenders according to its 2017-18 annual report. Bankers said that with the acknowledgement of a default, the airline will be classified as SMA-0 in all bank books and lenders will have to monitor loans to Jet more closely.“Furthermore, the company has large debt repayments due over December 2018 to March 2019 (Rs 1,700 crore), FY2020 (Rs 2,444.5 crore) and FY 2021 (Rs 2,167.9 crore). The company is undertaking various liquidity initiatives, which includes, among others, equity infusion and a stake sale in Jet Privilege Private Limited (JPPL), and the timely implementation of these initiatives remain critical to its credit profile,” ICRA said in its statement.Jet has been trying to coax strategic partner Etihad Airways to buy more stake in the carrier, but the Gulf airline won’t budge unless it gets chairman founder Naresh Goyal’s controlling stake. Goyal isn’t willing to cede. Etihad owns 24% in Jet.Jet has also proposed to SBI and the lending consortium for liquidity assistance and alternatively to convert their loans to equity. The lenders have said they won't provide any assistance until Jet’s founders and shareholders put in cash into the airline.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:30 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/jet-airways-defaults-on-loan-repayments-to-banks/articleshow/67344729.cms

The electricity, natural gas, and clean energy delivery company had filed a lawsuit against Wipro, seeking damages of $140 million and additional costs related to an enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation project.  Tata Consultancy Services won an employment discrimination case after a court in California acquitted the company of charges that it had bias towards Indian employees over US residents. Another oft-repeated accusation has been Indian firms abusing the H-1B visa process to bring Indians to the US rather than hire locals. In a similar case, a former HCL Technologies employee in the US filed a case against the company, alleging it promoted and chose H-1B visa holders to work on a project, who were mostly Indians.Cognizant has been awarded a partial relief in a classaction lawsuit filed in the US against its CEO Francisco D’Souza, CFO Karen McLoughlin and former president Gordon Coburn on allegations of improper payments related to securing SEZ licences in India that were a possible violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The lawsuit said Cognizant signed agreements in 2015 to expand its global delivery centre in Coimbatore and Chennai, which could house 20,000 professionals. The lawsuit alleged payments were then booked as capital expenditures rather than operating expenses, disguising the payments and inflating the reported investments in SEZ facilities. In March last year, Cognizant said it had incurred $27 million in costs related to the FCPA investigation and related lawsuits.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesUS news website Axios reported that San Francisco-based Northgate Capital sued Tech Mahindra after the latter missed a payment schedule.","Jan 02, 2019, 10:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/most-desi-it-companies-sued-for-staff-bias-in-2018/articleshow/67344768.cms

Startup investors plan for tax demand shield,Tweak agreements to include protection against any sudden I-T Dept impositions,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 02, 2019)BENGALURU: The angel tax worries of 2018 are pushing early-stage institutional investors to try and protect themselves from future IT issues by introducing indemnity clauses in agreements with investee companies. Some investors have had conversations on this with companies they are close to investing in, multiple sources said.Indemnity clauses are often part of large funding rounds, or in mergers and acquisitions. But they are normally not part of small fund raises by early-stage startups, corporate lawyers said. An indemnity clause functions like an insurance protection and is worked out between the founder and investor, based on several conditions related to the startup’s operations and long-term plan.Many investing funds are registered outside India and they are worried about what would happen if tax authorities in the country question the valuations being made by foreign investors in homegrown startups.“Investors looking at such indemnity clauses before investing in startups is certainly not a common practice. Angel tax has been a cause of concern and now emerging trends like this (indemnity clauses) could impact the pace of capital being raised by startups,” said Supratim Chakraborty, associate partner in law firm Khaitan & Co.A founder of an early-stage startup in the middle of a pre-series A fund raise said his new investors are bargaining hard to include an indemnity clause that would ensure they would have no liability in case of a loss incurred by the company over tax-related issues. The founder did not want to be named since the discussions are confidential and the fund-raise round is still a work-in-progress.Over the past few weeks, TOI has been speaking to entrepreneurs who have raised their voice against what they believe is harassment by the tax-department. They say the tax notices are impacting their operations severely.","Jan 02, 2019, 10:48 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/startup-investors-plan-for-tax-demand-shield/articleshow/67344676.cms

Amendments will include the extreme provision of taking down apps and websites in violation.The move comes days after senior IT ministry officials met representatives from top social media and internet companies and sought views on proposed rules that would help trace the origin of unlawful content.“We need accountability and power to heavily penalise the companies in case of violations, or refusal to cooperate,” a senior government official told TOI on condition of anonymity.The amendments could potentially impact the operations of popular services like WhatsApp, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Telegram and UCWeb.Some of these services have had differences with the government over the issue of tracing the origin of content that is fake, scope of encryption, content deemed interfering with politics and elections, spread of child abuse and revenge porn.The government had last year carried out an exercise to determine whether blocking websites and apps was technically feasible, if telecom companies and internet service providers were asked to do so.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories‘Penalties that we have under IT Act need to be revised’Even the penalties that we currently have under the IT Act are not sufficient and need to be revised.Many global companies have big turnover and relatively-small penalties may not be a sufficient deterrence.

Private banks are waking up to the call of heartland,"According to RBI data for 2018, private sector banks expanded their branch network in rural areas by more than 27% and in small towns by almost 18.4%, compared with 0.5% growth rate seen among public sector lenders.","BENGALURU: Private sector banks have steadily expanded their branch network in rural and semiurban markets, dwarfing the branch growth rate seen among public sector lenders, according to data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).According to RBI data for 2018, private sector banks expanded their branch network in rural areas by more than 27% and in small towns by almost 18.4%, compared with 0.5% growth rate seen among public sector lenders.By the end of last year, private banks had 6,160 branches in rural areas, up from 4,822 a year ago, while in semi-urban areas the number had grown to 9,242 from 7,803. Public sector banks, which have historically had a strong nonurban presence, had 29,201branches in rural areas against 29,033 at the end of 2017. In metro cities, private banks have increased branches by 8% to 7,477, but government-owned banks have reduced the number of branches by 1.7% to 18,546.“In terms of our network, 53% of the branches are in semi-urban and rural areas. The idea is to combine physical network with digital, thus creating the ‘Phygital’ approach,” an HDFC Bank spokesperson told ET.The fact that these lenders are specifically targeting smaller towns is evident by the sheer number of branches in those areas. With 9,242 branches, private banks have more offices in semi-urban areas than metro cities where there are 7,477 branches.Bankers pointed out that public sector banks have shown slower growth because they are already present across the length and breadth of the country. For catering to ‘Jan Dhan’ account holders, these entities have been the driving force of financial inclusion for the government.The RBI data also shows that among the private banks, Bandhan Bank has the largest number of branches in rural and semi-urban locations. With 2,621 branches, it is ahead of HDFC Bank — the country’s largest lender in terms of assets — which has 2,495.Highlighting the fact that there have been much-improved financial parameters in the heartland of the country, Virat Diwanji, president of retail liabilities and branch banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said that most banks have seen impressive loan and deposit growth from these areas.“This can be attributed to a number of factors, such as improvement of infrastructure in these markets, the agriculture sector doing well on a consistent basis, availability of credit bureau data that has led to improved credit culture, and technology that has helped in bringing down the cost of doing business in remote locations for banks,” he said.Kotak Mahindra Bank has 472 branches in smaller locations in the country. In fact, the bank had also promoted itself as being present in every nook and corner of the country after acquiring ING Vysya in 2015.The trend indicates that while banks are almost becoming technology companies themselves and taking services digital, branch banking is not dead. The HDFC Bank spokesperson pointed out that branches coupled with digital processes can actually help take financial services to the masses.“In these markets as well, customers can choose the touchpoints they want to bank with us. It can be branches, mobile or any other digital banking/technology platforms. The choice is theirs,” said the HDFC Bank spokesperson.","Jan 02, 2019, 10:52 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/private-banks-are-waking-up-to-the-call-of-heartland/articleshow/67344674.cms

Nearly 80% of FY19 credit growth comes in September-November,"Much of the bank credit has gone towards personal loans and industry, with only the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) showing a decline in bank loans. ","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 02, 2019)Mumbai: Almost 80% of credit growth in the first eight months of the current fiscal has taken place between September and November. Much of the bank credit has gone towards personal loans and industry, with only the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) showing a decline in bank loans. Besides NBFCs, the medium and small enterprises (MSEs) segment also saw bank credit shrinking. Within industry, food processing, fertiliser, iron & steel, cement, petroleum and infrastructure (roads & power) led the growth. Of the total incremental credit expansion of Rs 4.35 lakh crore in the current fiscal, Rs 3.46 lakh crore is accounted for in the three months ended November.“This is encouraging and clearly evident across retail loans, including housing and personal loans. In fact, the pace of growth has significantly picked up in November with oil prices declining and possibly acting as a boost to discretionary spending that was declining pre-October. The pickup in retail credit growth is all the more encouraging as November witnessed 10 holidays across the country and this may have pushed out some retail loan demand into December with a delay in processing of fresh loan applications,” said SBI group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh.According to an SBI report, incremental retail credit expansion in the three months ended November stood at Rs 73,800 crore — higher than the same period in FY16 when it had last peaked, and highest in the last decade since FY08 from when sectoral data is available.In November, incremental credit to NBFCs fell to Rs 3,700 crore from Rs 16,000 crore in October, and Rs 56,500 crore in September, while it showed negative growth for MSEs. “It is, however, possible that credit to MSEs picked up in December following the launch of a new online scheme in November. Even after all this, credit to NBFCs and retail account for 45% of incremental credit expansion for the three months ended November,” said the SBI report.Additionally, aggregate bank credit data available up to December 7 shows that advances grew 15.1% year-on-year, while deposits grew 9.7%. This is the highest growth in bank credit in five years, as a 15% growth rate was last seen in November 2013. The numbers also show that there is a wedge between bank credit and deposit growth. On a year-to-date basis, deposits grew Rs 4,58,600 crore, while advances grew Rs 5,78,300 crore. The gap is being reflected in rising interest rates. HDFC, Bank of Baroda and Karnataka Bank have raised interest rates with effect from January 1.According to Ghosh, the liquidity deficit is running at close to Rs 90,000 crore since the last 63 days and this calls for continued open market operations by the RBI.","Jan 02, 2019, 12:34 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/nearly-80-of-fy19-credit-growth-comes-in-september-november/articleshow/67344860.cms

Sachin Bansal pays Rs 699 crore advance tax on gains from Flipkart sale,This includes capital gains tax from his income on sale of Flipkart stake to US retail giant Walmart.,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 02, 2019)NEW DELHI: Flipkart founder Sachin Bansal has deposited Rs 699 crore as advance tax for the first quarter of 2018-19 which includes capital gains tax from his income on sale of Flipkart stake to US retail giant Walmart. His partner and co-founder Binny Bansal is yet to disclose the capital gains made on his stake sale in the e-commerce platform, sources in the tax department have said.The income tax department had earlier sent notices to both Sachin and Binny Bansal along with other stakeholders to disclose capital gains made by sale of their shares in Flipkart. Similar notices were served on Walmart to ensure it pays withholding tax on capital gains made by foreign stakeholders of Flipkart. Walmart had late last year paid Rs 7,440 crore to the I-T department as withholding tax, months after it acquired 77% shares of Flipkart for around $16 billion. Walmart was later asked to furnish details of 46 shareholders of Flipkart, how much each of them had gained from the deal.According to sources, Bansals have not yet explained the total payments received from the sale of their venture to Walmart, the capital gain tax liability and how the tax payments have been scheduled. Sachin's payments have come as part of his advance tax obligation for the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Flipkart is a Singapore-registered company, and SoftBank and eBay were its major shareholders prior to its sale to Walmart on May 9. 2018.While short term capital gain tax of a maximum of 40% may be applicable on SoftBank, eBay will also have to pay short term capital gains tax but its rate of tax is likely to be 20% considering DTAA (double taxation avoidance agreement) with Singapore. The tax department is yet to calculate the actual capital gains tax applicable in the deal since it is still investigating the complex structure of investments made in Flipkart Ltd (Singapore), particularly by eBay, and has sought complete data wise fund flow from eBay and other subsidiaries into Flipkart Ltd.eBay had made investments in Flipkart Singapore through a network of companies registered in various jurisdictions. A Flipkart spokesperson had earlier refused to comment on the ongoing I-T proceedings.After the I-T notice, Walmart had deposited Rs 7,439.4 crore with the tax department as withholding tax on account of payments made to non-resident shareholders of the company. Not satisfied with the withholding tax deposited with the government, the I-T department further asked Walmart International Holdings, the buyer of majority shareholders of Flipkart Singapore, to explain the break-up of how much tax has been deducted from payment to each shareholder.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:41 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/sachin-bansal-pays-rs-699-crore-advance-tax-on-gains-from-flipkart-sale/articleshow/67344869.cms
PE-VC fundings close ’18 at record high of $33 billion,"Data from research firm Venture Intelligence showed a 36% increase in PE-VC investments during 2018 across 720 deals, compared to $24.3 billion invested across 734 deals in 2017. ","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 02, 2019)CHENNAI: Indian startups ended 2018 at an all-time high, as total value of Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) investments in 2018 clocked a record amount of $33 billion.Data from research firm Venture Intelligence showed a 36% increase in PE-VC investments during 2018 across 720 deals, compared to $24.3 billion invested across 734 deals in 2017. The country’s startup ecosystem entered a state of maturity in 2018 as investors were more selective with deals, but made higher value bets. There were 81 investments valued at $100 million or more in 2018, making up 77% of the total value. This tally stood at just 47 transactions in 2017. Among these 81 deals, 40 were larger than $200 million each, compared to just 30 such investments in the year-ago period, according to Venture Intelligence data.The eventful year also saw eight startups across the B2C and B2B sectors — such as Oyo, PolicyBazaar, Swiggy, Byjus, BillDesk, Freshworks and others — enter the elite unicorn club. While historically, deal announcements are subdued at the year-end, Venture Intelligence data showed that December 2018 alone saw 43 deals valued at $3.2 billion, almost double the value of investments raised in the same period last year.“The midyear Walmart-Flipkart deal clearly re-energised international investors’ appetite for mega bets in Indian internet and mobile companies,” Ärun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence, said. “This has helped offset slowdown in investments in sectors like financial services, manufacturing and infrastructure towards the year end triggered by nervousness in the public markets and the IL&FS scare,” he added.The year brought about an inflection point for the PE-VC industry in terms of exits as well. Value of exits achieved by investors during the year stood at $25.4 billion- a 78% increase from the exits clocked in 2017.In line with previous years, IT and IT-enabled services companies accounted for close to 33% of the investment pie, thanks to Swiggy’s $1 billion raise in December from Naspers and others, and Oyo closing a $1 billion raise from SoftBank Vision Fund and others.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:00 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/pe-vc-fundings-close-18-at-record-high-of-33-billion/articleshow/67344847.cms

"Outlook 2019: Debt markets behaved like quicksilver in 2018, says Lakshmi Iyer of Kotak AMC",,"By Lakshmi IyerWelcome to a brand new calendar year!January is named after the two-headed Greek God Janus, the God of beginnings. Just as one head of Janus looks back upon the year gone by, the other head looks forward to a New Year – it is only fitting that we reflect upon the year gone by before making any divinations about the year ahead.2018: QUICKSILVER MARKETS2018 saw markets everywhere, globally as well as domestically, behave like quicksilver – ever-shifting and unpredictable. The year has been one of the worst on record this decade for global bond markets.Rising benchmark interest rates, expectations of slower global growth and wavering outlook on oil prices have been the key drivers for negative returns, dampening investor demands and widening spreads.Against a backdrop of choppy global bond yields, slowing global growth, escalating tariff wars and geopolitical tensions, Indian gilts have had a trying year. Starting with 7.34 per cent-levels in January 2018, the 10-year gilt improved to their annual low of 7.13 per cent in the first week of April and then went on to hit a high of 8.18 per cent in September.Post September, the pressure on Indian gilts seems to have eased as the 10-year gilt rallied to 7.25 per cent level. This rally has been driven mainly by significant cooling in crude prices, back-to-back OMO announcements by RBI, a strengthening rupee and rejuvenation in FII inflows. Agencies Crude prices hit a record high of $86.09 a barrel at the beginning of October 2018 before cooling down by ~36 per cent to hover around the $55 a barrel as on December 20, 2018.For this financial year, RBI has already announced and/or carried out cumulative OMOs worth Rs 2.26 lakh crore. Despite the jitters felt due to various credit events that unfolded during 2018, markets seem to be exhibiting resilience. Domestic investors continued their buying into mutual funds even as FIIs sold.Certain macro-economic indicators are showing a clear, positive trend and, suddenly, a lot of problems seem to be vanishing – a stable rupee, benign inflation (Read CPI) lower crude prices and RBI’s continued OMOs despite maintaining a hawkish guidance. This spells positive for 2019.2019: The year aheadWith 2018 being a rocky one for the markets, I am reminded of a famous dialogue from the Bollywood movie Sholay, “Ab tera kya hoga Kalia…” Calendar 2018 tested the mettle of most seasoned investors – be it retail or institutional. But we hope to see the positivity last well into 2019.At the moment, as 10-year yields stay steady around 7.25 per cent level, the market is clearly watchful of how the general elections play out, whether the positive trend in credit offtake sustains, how systemic liquidity pans out and how all of these influence interest rates. Clearly, elections, systemic liquidity, credit assets and interest rates are going to be the quartet to watch out for over the coming quarters.The current central government has maintained its emphasis on fiscal prudence and has clearly indicated its intent to remain within the targeted fiscal deficit range of 3.3 per cent. Will there be a likely slippage on this front as elections loom is the question markets will seek answer to. However, one needs to note that every act India carries out on the fiscal front could have implications on our external ratings front.With FII investors returning to the fold and domestic inflows continuing, we expect RBI to make efforts to ensure that core liquidity goes from deficit zone to neutral zone. We expect RBI to achieve this primarily by doing OMOs, and if the current account deficit (CAD) appears comfortable, then through forex purchases.Overall, with inflation appearing to be contained in the comfort zone and oil prices continuing to remain supportive, RBI is likely to keep the markets in the comfort zone.With crude and inflation remaining stable, RBI’s MPC is unlikely to hike interest rates in the near future. In fact, a situation is emerging which may lead to markets discounting rate cuts, instead.India, today, has one of the highest positive real interest rates and we expect this to results in an increase in financial savings, which will boost liquidity for the formal lending sector.Reduced expectation of interest rate hikes has erased the rate hike premium, which was getting built into the Indian yield curve. While government bond yield curve has normalised, there is still a lot of scope in the corporate bond yield curve to come down.The risk of a full-blown trade war remains a concern for the coming year as well. Though the trade war tensions seem to have ebbed considerably in recent months, they are far from resolved. This, coupled with the outcome of general elections would be the two key risks among other factors to watch out for.The US Fed has been mellowing its stance on aggressive rate hikes and that certainly spells good news for India. Today, we are in a situation where a dialogue from Bollywood movie Deewar sounds apt… “Aaj mere paas gaadi hai, bungla hai, paisa hai……” We have a visible macro tailwind clearly in our favour. The key is to build on it and continue to retain the tag of the fastest growing economy in the world!Wish you a Happy New Near!

"China slowdown, trade disputes weigh on Asia factory activity","With growth slowing, Asian central banks are unlikely to continue their tightening cycle this year.","HONG KONG: Factory activity weakened across Asia in December as the Sino-U.S. trade war and a slowdown in Chinese demand hit production in most economies, strengthening the case for a pause in interest rate hikes in the region in 2019. A series of purchasing managers' indexes for December released on Wednesday mostly showed declines or slowdowns in manufacturing factory activity across the region. In China, the Caixin/Markit PMI slipped into contraction territory for the first time in 19 months, broadly tracking an official survey released on Monday. China's weakness spilled over to other Asian economies, with Malaysia's manufacturing activity shrinking to its weakest pace of expansion since it launched the survey in 2012 and Taiwan contracting to its lowest since September 2015. Meanwhile, official economic data out of Singapore showed its gross domestic product grew more slowly than forecast in the fourth quarter as the city-state's manufacturing sector contracted on a quarterly basis. In other regions, the euro zone was expected to post steady manufacturing activity growth, while U.S. activity was seen a tad slower, but firmly in expansion territory, in a sign that so far China has suffered more bruises from its trade frictions than the United States. With growth slowing and inflation below or barely within target in most countries, Asian central banks are unlikely to continue their tightening cycle this year, baring any shocks in currency markets. ""We are really seeing a global slowdown into this year, and in Asia, particularly export-oriented countries are hurting,"" said Irene Cheung, Asia strategist at ANZ. ""Our expectation for central banks is that most of them won't change policy in 2019 and these numbers coming out on the weak side won't change that outlook."" The world's two largest economies agreed at the start of December to a 90-day truce following tit-for-tat tariffs that have disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods between the two countries. The two sides have pledged to hold frequent talks in the next two months, but uncertainty over whether they can bridge massive differences over commercial practices and intellectual property rights remains very high, despite U.S. President Donald Trump noting ""big progress"" in a tweet.  Tariffs are not the only drag on China's economy. Beijing's sustained drive to reduce debt risks in the economy has cooled the property market and curbed credit flows to the private sector. Meanwhile, the government's intensified crackdown on pollution has dented industrial activity. In a key annual conference last month, China's top leaders said they will boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and keeping liquidity ample, while promising to continue negotiations with Washington. ""The People's Bank of China may have to ease further to offset the impact of tariffs,"" said Robert Michele, chief investment officer and head of fixed income, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. China's economic growth slowed to 6.5 percent in the third quarter of last year, the weakest since the global financial crisis. Reuters reported that government advisers had recommended a growth target of 6.0-6.5 percent for this year at the annual meeting, though the final figure won't be made public until the annual parliament meeting in early March.OIL DRIVE A sharp drop in the crude price at the end of last year has helped sentiment in Asia's oil-importing economies, where trade deficits are a key vulnerability. Indonesia's PMI index, although still weak historically, rose to 51.2 from November's 50.4, a four-month high. India's declined to 53.2 from 54.0, but capped the strongest quarter for the country's manufacturing sector since late 2012. Philippines PMI was also 53.2. But Malaysia, which relies heavily on oil revenues, saw its weakest reading ever at 46.8. Taiwan and South Korea, which are heavily focused on tech production, also saw their activity shrink. The U.S.-China trade war affects chip orders and coincides with a slowdown in demand for smartphones globally. The contraction in South Korean manufacturing activity continued last month albeit at a slower pace, its PMI showed, with new export orders declining for a fifth consecutive month. Taiwan's PMI, meanwhile, fell to its lowest since September 2015. Japan publishes PMIs on Jan. 4. Vietnam's PMI fell to 53.8 from November's 56.5, but the index's 2018 average was the highest since the survey's debut in 2011. The Southeast Asian economy is widely seen as benefiting from the U.S.-China trade war as companies look to establish operations in the country to avoid the tariff crossfire.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:13 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/china-slowdown-trade-disputes-weigh-on-asia-factory-activity/articleshow/67345087.cms
"Expect 12-14% earnings growth over next couple of years: Mayuresh Joshi, Angel Broking","
One should be very selective in IT and pharma and hold on to top tier names, says the fund manager.","One should place bets on sectors like banks, consumption, FMCG, staples and very selectively in infrastructure      and cement for 2019, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:   Advice for clients in 2019 2018 was very, very volatile.

View Stock Analysis »What happens with Brexit over the next few months is going to be very critical from a global market standpoint as is the reversal of the quantitative easing programme as far as the ECB is concerned. Domestically again, elections are there but that will be just a hiccup from a very short-term perspective.  It is corporate earnings which provide the base for markets. The utilisation level as per the RBI report is 76 odd percent. That indicates that corporate earnings will pick up for the next fiscal. This year, has largely been a disappointment as far as earnings are concerned but if private capex starts coming through as it seems from the RBI report, my own sense is that the markets specifically looking at corporate earnings as a base factor in terms of how the positioning looks to be quite feasible over the next couple of years.  So our base case is 12-14% earnings growth over the next couple of years and that would provide base for the markets. One should place bets on sectors like banks, consumption, FMCG, staples and very selectively in infrastructure and cement for 2019.On aviation A large part of aviation and OMC stocks are dependent on two key variables – crude oil and rupee. So again the crude sensitivity and the rupee sensitivity to earnings is quite significant. Both these variables have come down very sharply. Crude has corrected significantly and the rupee has appreciated against the dollar and that should support the earnings sensitivity for a lot of these companies.  But again selectively for these sectors as well when you are probably talking about how the quarter might pan out, OMCs would have faced inventory losses because the crude buying would have happened at higher prices. Also, where we are seeing crude at this point of time is also going to have an impact on their balance sheet.  As for sensitivity concern in terms of other segments as well, we are probably looking at petrochemicals or the petchem segment and the downstream products being correlated to crude pricing. Once crude pricing comes down, so do the realisations which are obviously cut off set by larger volumes and the pipeline volume should also hold up.  What probably happens in their case is the capex that they are entailing at this point of time obviously will affect their cash flow discipline and the free cash flows in particular. It is a large element in terms of earnings being very volatile and even for the aviation counters, the cost per available seat kilometre excluding fuel, the optimisation should be significant there and the revenue per available seat kilometre will again have a say because competition is still very intense which will have an effect on yields.On export-oriented themes IT and pharma remain a major chunk of the export-oriented themes. Guidance given by majors like Accenture and Cognizant point to some sort of a slowdown. In terms of how the yields are stacking up in the US markets, if you genuinely believe that a slowdown is expected to come through, what kind of an impact does that have in terms of discretionary spending patterns of US corporates is going to be extremely critical.  The kind of commentaries that a lot of IT companies have reported in the quarter gone by and assuming that both the dollar revenues and the constant currency revenues should remain extremely stable, aptly supported by the digital wins that they have probably got and the kind of share that digital investments have probably made in terms of their overall top line, the parameters that one really needs to look out for is how the different sub-segments might pan out. BFSI is going to be extremely critical in terms of spending patterns. Retail, manufacturing, lifesciences segments probably are picking up. Travel insurance is showing signs of stability as well and that is getting reflected in terms of their bench strength which basically means that the utilisation levels are looking stable and attrition numbers should come down as order flows and order books start stacking up.  So, again not too pessimistic on the sector as a whole, My view is that qualitative stocks within the IT pack, the largecaps, should very well be held on to. One needs to be very selective on midcaps. It is a similar story in pharma because a large part of the positivity of their earnings have played out. The concerns over US FDA, pricing related issues and the elevated R&D expenditure for creating niche generic pipeline, all those concerns, are genuinely behind us but earnings trajectory will be very specific for a few counters which can outperform.  One should be very selective in IT and pharma and hold on to top tier names in the IT and pharma packs. On auto There was a horrific slowdown in the auto industry as a whole. One was really expecting some pick up to start happening in the festive season. Sanity returned before Diwali but again the December numbers have been largely disappointing. Now, in light of the price hikes that these auto companies have taken from this month onwards, how that translates in terms of volume growth is going to be critical. If you divide the industry into four main sub-segments -- four-wheelers, two-wheelers, agri machinery and the M&HCV/LCV -- there are signs of inherent slowdown, specifically in the M&HCV segment.  The LCV leg of the market is holding up. But over the next two quarters, as BS-VI starts nearing its implementation, pre-buying will be very evident in numbers. You might see some patchiness in numbers as far as that part of the segment is concerned over the next few months but it should start recovering.  In case of four wheelers, volume normalisation should start soon. For two-wheelers in particular, we have spoken about a lot of schemes that the government has done. We have understood the entire concept in terms of rural discretionary spending having a very positive impact. But what probably is happening on ground at this point of time is thar with selling prices of agriculture produce being very low, the disposable income in rural India remains minuscule. In terms of agri equipment like tractors, there has been a reasonable volume growth as per data put out by by Escorts, M&M etc. This indicates a double digit volume growth of 10 to 11 odd per cent. Even that should translate into balance sheet dynamics. For the sector as a whole, if somebody holds Ashok Leyland, they should continue to hold it. There is some pain in terms of volume but as normalisation happens and margins come back over the next few months, qualitative stocks like Maruti can also be held on into your portfolio.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:15 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/expect-12-14-earnings-growth-over-next-couple-of-years-mayuresh-joshi-angel-broking/articleshow/67345117.cms

Rohit Bal feels fashion industry is witnessing 'the death of originality',The designer is not a fan of the current trend of celebrities being vehicles of fashion collections.,"Age hasn’t stopped Rohit Bal from having strong opinions. One of India’s first star designers is not a fan of the current trend of celebrities being vehicles of fashion collections.“Now all I see is a C-class celebrity walking the ramp,” Bal said in a magazine interview recently. “I don’t see the collection being highlighted in articles or on social media. No interviews of the designers. It’s like a virus eating into fashion and destroying it. It’s seeping into people’s mindsets – everyone looks the same. I think we’re going through the death of originality.” Some marks to Bal for saying it like it is. A Royal Evening In Paris: Scindia, Birla, Mehta - The Indian Débutantes At Le BalAutoplay1 of 5A Night To RememberThe 26th le Bal was a power-packed soirée as twenty débutantes and cavaliers from prominent families around the world came together for an evening of high fashion, networking and fund raising.Started in 1992, le Bal des Débutantes - the brainchild of Ophélie Renouard, is hosted in the French Capital every year to raise funds and awareness for two causes – Enfants d’Asie (Children of Asia) and The Selini Institute, a non-profit organisation providing care and supporting the mental health of women and teenage mothers.This year saw four Indian heirs and heiresses make their debut at the high society affair that has earlier been attended by Isha Ambani, Maharaja of Jaipur Padmanabh Singh and his sister Princess Gauravi Kumari, and Ananya Pandey.In Pic: This year's débutantes at le Bal. Fairy Tale MomentThe guest list at the ball, held at the Shangri-La Hotel in Paris, represents the legacy of renowned influential families across the arts, politics, business and culture – as they make an entry into the uppermost echelons of society.This year saw four Indian faces that included Princess Ananya Raje Scindia and Prince Yuvaraj Mahanaryaman Scindia of Gwalior, Aria Mehta and Shloka Birla.In Pic: Princess Ananya Raje Scindia of Gwalior with Shloka Birla (L); Shloka Birla, Aria Mehta with Payal Mehta (R).The RoyalsPrincess Ananya Raje Scindia chose a gown from Indo-French duo,Lecoanet-Hemant, who have dressed several débutantes over the years including Shaiyra Devi of Kapurthala in 2011. The 16-year-old was accompanied by her brother Prince Yuvaraj Mahanaryaman Scindia of Gwalior. Belle Of The BallAria Mehta, daughter of le Bal’s official jeweller Payal Mehta and her husband Dipu Mehta, made her debut at the gala. The young débutante opted for a couture creation by Lebanese designer George Hobeika as she twirled around the dance floor with her cavalier Count Rufus D Hauteville. Her elder sister, Ashna, also attended the Le Bal in 2014.Vision In WhiteShloka Birla, daughter of industrialist power couple Yash and Avanti Birla, opted for a glamorous cocktail dress by Indian couturier Manish Malhotra, paired with exquisite jewels from Payal New York. She was escorted by her cavalier HSH Prince Jean De Croy Solre. Malhotra goes a long way back when it comes to the Birlas.

"Manufacturing activity slows in December, PMI at 53.2",The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index declined to 53.2 in December from 54 in November.,"NEW DELHI: India’s manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in December as growth in new orders and output moderated, despite factories cutting their prices, a private survey showed on Wednesday.The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index declined to 53.2 in December from 54 in November.A reading of over 50 on this survey-based index indicates expansion, below that contraction.The manufacturing PMI “indicated that the sector ended 2018 on a high, with growth stronger than seen at the start of the year,” said Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.  As per the survey, the upturn in jobs was the slowest in four months, while backlogs were accumulated to the quickest extent since May.“Meanwhile, job creation weakened, with companies perhaps cautious about making hiring decisions ahead of next year’s elections and a less upbeat optimism towards the outlook,” De Lima said.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:30 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/manufacturing-activity-slows-in-december-pmi-at-53-2/articleshow/67345218.cms
"CIL fulfils quota, but power plants still low on stock","A top CIL executive said the dry fuel supplier has increased supplies by 8% to thermal power generators during April-December, 2018.","Coal India (CIL) has fulfilled its supply quota to almost all thermal power plants for April-December 2018, but stocks at some 36 plants are down to last between zero to three days due to increased thermal power demand.A top CIL executive said the dry fuel supplier has increased supplies by 8% to thermal power generators during April-December, 2018.“Last year Coal India sent close to 332 million tonnes of coal to the sector. This year, it has already sent around 358 million tonnes to the sector during the same period despite which some plants have depleting stocks,” the executive said.Central Electricity Authority data showed there are 10 power plants with no coal. CEA’s data also suggests that all these plants received coal amounting to either their slotted volume or more than their stipulated quantity for the period.Coal India, along with thermal power plants, calculates the annual contracted quantity (ACQ) of coal each power plant needs, to generate power at 80% capacity utilisation for a year.However, CIL does not supply the full quantity of coal required to generate power at 80% for a year. Instead, plants set up before April 2009 receive 90% of their annual contracted coal quantity, while those set up after April 2009 receive 75% of their annual contracted quantity.“We have already supplied either more than the contracted supply quantities on a pro rata basis to almost all plants or have met our supply obligations. Increased demand for power has forced them to generate extra power leading to depleting stocks” the CIL executive said.For example, the executive said, NTPC’s Korba Super thermal power station has received 101% of its annual contracted quantity on a pro rata basis between April-December 2018, yet the plant is stuck with zero-day coal stocks as it generated electricity at an average 87% capacity utilisation due to increased demand.In November the plant generated at almost 94% of its capacity.“They are producing more than their planned generation, using up stocks faster than anticipated, leading to stock depletion,” he said. CEA data suggests that nine power plants have coal stock for only one day. Out of this eight plants have received between 87% and 109% of their annual contracted quantity of coal.Another set of six plants is left with stocks for two days, though despite getting between 77% and 107% of their annual contracted quantity. Some six plants are stuck with four-day coal stocks although they have received between 77% and 107% of their annual contracted quantity.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:23 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/cil-fulfils-quota-but-power-plants-still-low-on-stock/articleshow/67345191.cms

China building 'most advanced' naval warships for Pakistan: Report,"Equipped with modern weapon systems, it will be capable of anti-ship, anti-submarine & air-defence operations.","BEIJING: China is building the first of four ""most advanced"" naval warships for its ""all-weather ally"" Pakistan as part of a major bilateral arms deal to ensure among other things ""balance of power"" in the strategic Indian Ocean, state media reported.Equipped with modern detection and weapon systems, it will be capable of anti-ship, anti-submarine and air-defence operations, China Daily quoted state-owned defence contractor China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) as saying.The under-construction ship is a version of the Chinese Navy's most advanced guided missile frigate, it said.The CSSC did not specify the ship's type but said it is being constructed at its Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai.China, an ""all-weather ally"" of Islamabad, is the largest supplier of weapon system to Pakistan. Both the countries also jointly manufacture JF-Thunder a single engine multi-role combat aircraft.The ship's class is Type 054AP, which means it is based on the Type 054A of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, the report quoted the Pakistani Navy as saying.The Pakistani Navy previously said four such ships had been ordered, according to the report.Once constructed, the warship ""will be one of the largest and technologically advanced platforms of the Pakistani Navy and strengthen the country's capability to respond to future challenges, maintain peace and stability and the balance of power in the Indian Ocean region,"" the report said.It will also support the Pakistani Navy's initiative of securing sea lanes for international shipping by patrolling distant waters, the daily quoted the CSSC as saying.The mention of the Indian Ocean is regarded as significant as China, which has already taken over Pakistan's strategic Gwadar port under the multi-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), looks to assist the Pakistani navy to restore the balance of power in India's backyard.China has acquired the logistical military base in Djibouti and taken over the Hambantota port of Sri Lanka under a 99-year debt swap deal.China recently denied a New York Times report that it finalised a plan to build advanced fighter aircraft under the CPEC in Pakistan, adding a military dimension to it.India protested to China over the CPEC as it is being laid through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Pakistan became the first country to hook on to China's BeiDou Satellite Navigation System, a rival to the US Global Positioning System (GPS) which went global recently. The system was expected to be used for military applications.The report said Type 054A is the best frigate in service with the PLA Navy. Military sources said the ship has a fully loaded displacement of about 4,000 metric tonnes and is equipped with advanced radars and missiles. About 30 Type 054As are in service with the PLA Navy.An insider in China's shipbuilding sector with knowledge of the Type 054AP programme told the Daily that the ship is the largest and most powerful combat vessel China has ever exported.""Based on pictures circulating on the internet, the ship will have vertical launch cells that can fire Chinese HQ-16 air-defence missiles and other kinds of missiles. Vertical launch cells will bring flexibility to the user in terms of weapons portfolio, thus giving it a stronger fighting capability,"" he said, adding that the Type 054AP is the best frigate Pakistan can access in the international market.""The service of Type 054APs will double the combat power of the Pakistani Navy's surface fleet,"" he said.Commenting on the ship's construction, Cao Weidong, a senior researcher at the PLA's Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said in the past, the Pakistani Navy would ask its Chinese contractors to use Western radars or weapons on ships constructed by the Chinese shipbuilders because it believed the Western naval technologies were better than Chinese ones.""But it seems that all weapons and radars on the new ship will be Chinese products, which reflects our progress in the industry and the Pakistani Navy's confidence in our technology and capability,"" he said.Cao said there are many nations selling frigates in the market, so Pakistan must have made thorough comparisons in terms of combat capability and costs.""I believe the reason they chose our type is that ours is one of the few that can carry out all of the air-defence, anti-ship and anti-submarine tasks,"" he said, expecting the service of the Chinese frigate to substantially boost Pakistan's defence capability.","Jan 03, 2019, 06:06 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-building-most-advanced-naval-warships-for-pakistan-report/articleshow/67345177.cms
Steel bridge is talk of town again in Bengaluru,The project made headlines in 2016 and 2017 when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister. It was dropped in March 2017 following public outcry and protest demonstrations.,"Bengaluru: The state government has decided to revive the controversial steel bridge project that was originally planned between Hebbal flyover and Basaveshwara Circle three years ago. Deputy chief minister G Parameshwara, in a chat with mediapersons on Tuesday, said the government wished to take a relook at the project, taking sections of citizens by surprise. The 6.9-km flyover project, he said, will ease congestion on the airport road. The project, estimated to cost `2,100 crore, came under flak from citizen groups and political parties. The BJP made allegations of corruption as the project award came ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Environment groups protested on the grounds that the bridge, if built, would claim 812 trees.The project made headlines in 2016 and 2017 when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister. It was dropped in March 2017 following public outcry and protest demonstrations. Parameshwara, who is also in charge of Bengaluru City Development, said the government was keen to revive it in public interest. The government saw the need for reviving the project in view of increasing congestion on the airport road. His cabinet colleague DK Shivakumar also spoke in support of the project.The government, the deputy CM said, will lay before the public the details of the project, its larger public purpose, estimated cost and benefits and invite their comments. He will later bring it up before the cabinet for a final call. According to him, it currently takes more than 45 minutes to reach the international airport from Basaveshwara Circle. The steel bridge will cut the travel time to 20 minutes, he said. The government is prepared to correct any shortcomings there may be in the project proposal, he said. The announcement evoked sharp criticism from the BJP. Opposition leader BS Yeddyurappa wondered how chief minister HD Kumaraswamy would approve the project as he had earlier opposed it when the JD(S) was in the Opposition. Senior BJP leader R Ashoka said the party will continue to resist the project. It is not clear how the government intends to design the steel flyover as the much larger, elevated corridor project, planned to connect east-west and north-south parts of Bengaluru and passing over six high-density roads, also interferes with it. A portion of the 102-km elevated corridor runs on Ballari Road. The elevated corridor itself is estimated to cost `26,000 crore.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:34 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/steel-bridge-is-talk-of-town-again-in-bengaluru/articleshow/67345365.cms

"China plans 6,800 km of new rail track in 2019 amid infrastructure push","At least 3,200 kilometres of this target will be high-speed rail, the China Railway Corp said in a post on its official WeChat account.","China plans to invest in 6,800 kilometres (4,225 miles) worth of new railway lines in 2019, a 40 percent jump from the length of tracks laid last year, the national railway operator said on Wednesday amid a wider push to boost infrastructure spending. At least 3,200 kilometres of this target will be high-speed rail, the China Railway Corp said in a post on its official WeChat account. China Railway Corp said it invested in 4,683 kilometres worth of new rail lines last year, of which 4,100 were high-speed rail. The country invested 802.9 billion yuan ($117.12 billion) in rail fixed assets in 2018, the company added. It had set an initial budget of 732 billion yuan in January last year. It did not give an investment target for 2019. China has spent billions of dollars in its railway network over the past decade, but there have been signs that this was starting to slow as the network grew and Beijing began to crack down on local government debt. Its 2018 investment target was its lowest since 2013. However, the government began to speed up investment spending in the second half of last year in a bid to spur growth in the country's slowing economy by approving new railway projects and reviving suspended ones.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:37 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/china-plans-6800-km-of-new-rail-track-in-2019-amid-infrastructure-push/articleshow/67345419.cms
Palm hits near two-week high as India cuts import tax,"Trading volumes stood at 14,848 lots of 25 tonnes each at noon on Wednesday.
","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian palm oil futures rose to their highest in nearly two weeks at the midday break of the first trading day of 2019, after world's largest edible oil importer India announced import tax cuts, amid expectations of a fall in production.  The benchmark palm oil contract for March delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was up 1.7 per cent at 2,156 ringgit ($521.15) a tonne at the midday break. It earlier rose as much as 1.8 per cent to 2,159 ringgit, its strongest levels since Dec. 21.  Trading volumes stood at 14,848 lots of 25 tonnes each at noon on Wednesday. ""Palm is higher today on India's import tax cut and production, which is expected to be down for the whole month also,"" said a futures trader in Singapore. Palm oil output in Malaysia, the second largest producer of the vegetable oil, seasonally declines in the first few months of the year after peaking in the previous quarter. November production had slid 6.09 per cent from the previous month to 1.85 million tonnes, according to industry regulator data. India, the world's largest importer of edible oils, said late on Monday it would lower the duty on crude palm oil imports to 40 per cent from 44 per cent, while a tax on refined oils was cut to 50 per cent from 54 per cent.  Malaysian shipments of refined palm oil, however, will be taxed at 45 per cent compared with 54 per cent earlier. Despite the tax cuts, traders expect market gains to be short-lived as palm inventory levels in Southeast Asia remain high. In other related oils, the January soybean oil contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose 0.6 per cent and the Dalian January palm oil contract gained 1.5 per cent. Palm oil prices are impacted by changes in soyoil prices, as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oil market.

","NEW DELHI: The country's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Wednesday called for reduction in GST rate on bikes and scooters to 18 per cent from the current rate of 28 per cent.The company, which ended last year with record sales of over eighty (rpt) eighty lakh units, said the reduction in tax would provide much-needed relief to two-wheeler customers across the country.""Given that two-wheelers provide basic mobility to the masses, there is an urgent need to reduce the GST rate on two-wheelers from the 28 per cent bracket of ‘luxury goods' to that of 18 per cent for mass usage items,"" Hero MotoCorp Chairman Pawan Munjal said in a statement.The reduction in tax rate would not only help millions of two-wheeler customers, but also the entire value chain dependent on the sector, he added.""It is absolutely imperative to ensure growth in the auto sector to create and sustain inclusive economic growth,"" Munjal said.He added that with transition to BS VI emission norms, cost of two-wheelers will further go up.""All these will put severe stress on the extremely cost-sensitive commuters, for whom the two-wheeler is a lifeline,"" Munjal said.Terming 2018 as a challenging year, he added that while the continuing volatility in currency and commodities slowed down the pace of growth, the global geopolitical and trade conflicts also affected sentiments in markets and industries across the world.Commenting on domestic market, Munjal said the increased cost of two-wheeler insurance ahead of the festive season and the prevailing liquidity crunch in the market impacted the overall of growth in the industry during the entire third quarter.On sales outlook for the remaining part of the fiscal, he said that with an improved liquidity in the market, and the upcoming festive season in many parts of the country, the industry is expecting a positive turnaround in the fourth quarter.In the calender year 2018, Hero MotoCorp sold 80,39,472 units of bikes and scooters, registering a growth of 11 per cent over 2017.In the April-December period of the current fiscal, the company has sold a total of 60,37,901 units, the two wheeler major said.In December 2018, Hero MotoCorp sold 4,53,985 units, as compared with 4,72,731 units in the year ago period.","Jan 02, 2019, 12:12 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/hero-motocorp-pitches-for-18-gst-on-two-wheelers/articleshow/67345453.cms
Women form human chain in Mumbai to support Kerala 'Women's Wall',"On Tuesday, over 35 lakh women stood shoulder-to- shoulder across the national highways in Kerala, creating a 620 km-long human 'wall' from the northern end of Kasaragod to the state's southern tip.","Over 1,000 women formed a human chain in Mumbai to express solidarity with the 'Women's Wall' formed in Kerala as part of an initiative to uphold gender equality amid the row over entry of females of certain ages in the Sabarimala temple.On Tuesday, over 35 lakh women stood shoulder-to- shoulder across the national highways in Kerala, creating a 620 km-long human 'wall' from the northern end of Kasaragod to the state's southern tip.The 'Women's wall' was conceived in the backdrop of frenzied protests witnessed in the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala after the Kerala government decided to implement the Supreme Court verdict, allowing women of all ages to offer prayers at the shrine. Extending support to the campaign, women from several organisations and social activists came together to form a nearly one km-long human chain from Dadar Chowpatty to Shivaji Park in Mumbai on Tuesday evening.Sonya Gill, a member of the committee which organised the Mumbai women's chain, said around 1,000 to 1,200 women from the megapolis and the neighbouring Thane district and Navi Mumbai town gathered at the venue to form the chain.""We gathered to express solidarity for gender equality and what our sisters were doing in Kerala. We are not following our old values and traditions where women used to be given due respect in all fields,"" she said.A number of Muslim women also took part in the campaign and they carried banners with messages like ""neither we are impure nor second rate citizens.

"Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie move SC seeking review of Rafale verdict","In their review plea, they alleged that the judgment ""relied upon patently incorrect claims made by the government in an unsigned note given in a sealed cover"" to the apex court.","NEW DELHI: Former Union ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, and advocate Prashant Bhushan Wednesday moved the Supreme Court, seeking review of its December 14 verdict dismissing all PILs alleging irregularities in the procurement of 36 Rafale jets from France.In their review plea, they alleged that the judgment ""relied upon patently incorrect claims made by the government in an unsigned note given in a sealed cover"" to the apex court.They have also sought that the plea be heard in an open court.The Supreme Court had on December 14 last year dismissed the pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 jets, saying there was no occasion to ""really doubt the decision making process"" warranting setting aside of the contract.The top court had rejected the pleas seeking lodging of an FIR and the court-monitored probe alleging irregularities in the Rs 58,000 crore deal, in which both the countries have entered into an inter-governmental agreement (IGA).The Centre had on December 15 last year filed an application in the top court seeking correction in a paragraph in its judgement on the Rafale deal in which a reference was made about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report and Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC).In its judgement, the apex court had noted that the pricing details have been shared with CAG, and the report of the CAG has been examined by the PAC.The issue of CAG and PAC was mentioned in paragraph 25 of the judgement of the top court which had held that there were no irregularities in the procurement of the jets from France.The judgement had said that the material placed before it shows that the Centre did not disclose in Parliament the pricing details of the Rafale fighter jet, but revealed it to the Comptroller and Auditor General.After the verdict, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, who chairs the PAC, had said no such report had come to him.The Rafale fighter is a twin-engine Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) manufactured by French aerospace company Dassault Aviation.","Jan 02, 2019, 02:19 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/yashwant-sinha-arun-shourie-move-sc-seeking-review-of-rafale-verdict/articleshow/67345522.cms
"Oil kicks off 2019 with losses on signs of economic slowdown, surging supply","International Brent crude futures were at $53.19 per barrel at 0544 GMT, down 61 cents, or 1.1 percent, from their final close of 2018.","SINGAPORE: Oil markets dropped by around 1 percent in 2019's first trading on Wednesday, pulled down by surging U.S. output and concerns about an economic slowdown in 2019 as factory activity in China, the world's biggest oil importer, contracted. International Brent crude futures were at $53.19 per barrel at 0544 GMT, down 61 cents, or 1.1 percent, from their final close of 2018. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $44.95 per barrel, down 47 cents, or 1 percent. In physical oil markets, Dubai crude averaged $57.318 a barrel for December, the lowest since October 2017, two traders who participate in the market said on Wednesday. Similarly, Malaysia's Petronas set the official selling price of a basket of December-loading Malaysian crude grades at $62.79 a barrel, the lowest since October 2017, the state oil firm said on Wednesday. Traders said futures prices fell on expectations of oversupply amid surging U.S. production and concerns about a global economic slowdown. Factory activity weakened in December across Asia, including in China, as the Sino-U.S. trade war and a slowdown in Chinese demand hit production in most economies, pointing to a rocky start for the world's top economic growth region in 2019. Independent market analyst Greg McKenna said in a note on Wednesday that it was ""difficult for traders and investors to ignore what looks like a genuine global economic slowdown."" That is also impacting sentiment in oil markets. Oil prices ended 2018 lower for the first time since 2015, after a desultory fourth quarter that saw buyers flee the market over growing worries about too much supply and mixed signals related to renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. ""Oil prices ... registered their first yearly decline in three years on fears of a slowing global economy and concerns of an ongoing supply glut,"" said Adeel Minhas, a consultant at Australia's Rivkin Securities. For the year, WTI futures slumped nearly 25 percent, while Brent tumbled nearly 20 percent. The outlook for 2019 is riddled with uncertainty, analysts said, including the U.S.-China trade concerns and Brexit, as well as political instability and conflict in the Middle East. A Reuters poll showed oil prices are expected to trade below $70 per barrel in 2019 as surplus production, much of it from the United States, and slowing economic growth undermine efforts led by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut supply and prop up prices. On the production side, all eyes will be on the ongoing surge in U.S. output and on OPEC's and Russia's supply discipline. ""Don't underestimate shale producers and the wider U.S. oil industry in general. Too often this year the market pushed stories ... bottlenecks (pipelines, frack crews, truck drivers, etc.), yet U.S. oil production will have grown by a massive 2+ million barrels per day between 1.1.2018 and 1.1.2019,"" consultancy JBC Energy said in an analysis of 2018. U.S. crude output rose to an all-time high of 11.537 million barrels per day (bpd) in October, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday. That makes the U.S. the world's biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Weekly data, which is more open to revisions, was reported last week at 11.7 million bpd in late December by the EIA.

Reserve Bank of India surprises by reversing debt revamp stance,"RBI will allow one-time restructuring of loans to micro, small and medium-sized companies that are in default.","by Ronojoy MazumdarThe Reserve Bank of India will permit lenders to restructure stressed loans to small companies, breaking from a five-year-old policy of eschewing sweeping corporate debt overhauls.The Reserve Bank of India will allow one-time restructuring of loans to micro, small and medium-sized companies that are in default, the regulator said in a statement on Tuesday. To be eligible for the program, the loan should not exceed Rs 25 crore ($3.6 million), according to the statement.The latest directive is new central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das’s first big policy move and yields to the government’s call to provide relief to small firms, many of which are still suffering from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2016 cash-ban program. As much as Rs 1.3 lakh crore ($18.7 billion) of loans made to small firms are stressed, according to data from SBICAP Securities Ltd.“The biggest concern with such forbearance packages is the risk that such schemes could end up vitiating the repayment culture of honest MSME borrowers by encouraging defaults,” ASV Krishnan, vice president at SBICAP Securities, said in a note on Wednesday. Still, the RBI’s precondition for borrowers will “disincentivize any incremental non-repayment or defaults by existing standard borrowers,” he said.In Tuesday’s notice, the Reserve Bank asked lenders to set aside an additional 5 per cent for the debt that will be revamped under the program. Banks will have to make an extra provision of Rs 5,000 crore, said Anil Gupta, vice president, at ICRA Ltd., the Indian unit of Moody’s Investors Service.Previous governors including Raghuram Rajan and Urjit Patel have shunned loan revamp programs.The move was praised by Swaminathan Gurumurthy, a chartered accountant and a key advocate of easier rules for small companies on the central bank’s board. Gurumurthy, who is associated with the economic wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh — the ideological parent of Bharatiya Janata Party — is a champion of the small traders who are BJP’s key voting bloc.State-run banks under the Reserve Bank’s Prompt Corrective Action framework sanction will benefit from the move, according to Kotak Institutional Equities. Still, the brokerage said the timing of the move came as a surprise.The bad-loan ratio in India’s banking industry fell in September for the first time since 2015, with the central bank predicting it may drop further. The industry’s gross bad-loan ratio is expected to fall to 10.3 per cent by March from 10.8 per cent in September, the Reserve Bank said in its Financial Stability Report on Monday.""Lenders usually step back lending when the early warning indicators suggest rising trends of deterioration,” Kotak said in a report to clients on Wednesday. “However, the last available data suggests that lenders have been quite comfortable and growing this portfolio at a healthy pace.”","Jan 02, 2019, 12:08 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/reserve-bank-of-india-surprises-by-reversing-debt-revamp-stance/articleshow/67345597.cms

Citizens astonished as city corporators are busy with the game of road names,"In the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) monthly council meeting held last week, 25 out of the 75 subjects placed for approval were about naming/renaming of roads.","BENGALURU: A fortnight ago, a cross road in Vasanth Nagar got a new name overnight. Residents of the area were astonished to see the newly-etched signboard on the footpath with a name they had never heard of before. Soon the residents’ WhatsApp group, which includes the corporator, was flooded with messages, of residents wondering who the gentleman after whom the road was named is or was. The corporator did not respond initially, but when residents questioned him directly, it turned out that the person had lived in one of the oldest houses in the locality.In the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) monthly council meeting held last week, 25 out of the 75 subjects placed for approval were about naming/renaming of roads. With corporators showing an unusual interest in naming/renaming roads in their wards, residents are finding it difficult to relate to the new names that are often of “personalities” unheard of. Another case is that of Girls School Street, Seshadripuram. The road was renamed two years ago to please a certain community, which built a wedding hall in the locality. Residents of the area who have lived there for long, however, do not use the new name and they continue to call it Girls School Street. “We don’t understand the logic behind renaming roads. Whom are they trying to appease,” asked Chitra Venkatesh, secretary of Kumara Park West Residents’ Welfare Association.Corporators bring proposals for renaming roads based on representation at the local level. The BBMP calls for objections/suggestions to the proposed renaming, after which it is placed before the council for approval. Once approved in the council, proposals are sent to the Urban Development Department for final approval.An officer at the UDD revealed that it is highly unlikely the government will reject names approved in the corporation council. “We do not reject the proposal unless it seems to be objectionable in nature,” he pointed out.A senior officer in the BBMP, who did not wish to be named, said that by changing names or giving new names to roads, corporators are playing to the gallery. “Naming roads is the easiest thing they can do,” he noted.Corporators believe renaming roads is their right. “These small roads are developed using funds sanctioned to the corporator for ward-level works. Since corporators spend on developing minor road infrastructure, they take the opportunity to rename roads based on public pressure,” said Jayamahal corporator MK Gunashekhar. But the naming trend has visibly upset citizens. “The system of consulting people before renaming roads does not exist. Roads have a history attached to their names. Randomly changing those names will disassociate them from that history,” pointed out Vivek Chand, vice-president, Richmond Town Langford Town Resident Welfare Association.","Jan 02, 2019, 12:01 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/citizens-astonished-as-city-corporators-are-busy-with-the-game-of-road-names/articleshow/67345680.cms

The benefits of the weaker rupee only now will start fructifying for the IT services firm. My reckoning is even without any further depreciation, even if the rupee stays at 70 to the dollar, you will start seeing the benefits of the weaker rupee flow through now. Second, it is relatively clear looking at the gyration in the rupee that for exporters to be competitive, you need around 75 to the dollar and that obviously suggests that there is further tailwinds for IT companies, the pharma companies, the export pack as a whole. It is very difficult to see how our current account deficit will go back to semblance of normality without rupee reaching 75 to the dollar and the fact that the FPI inflows (bond and the equity inflows) are moderating as the cost of capital rises in America. This make it even more imperative that the CAD goes back towards say 1-1.5% of GDP level rather than the current levels closer to 2.5%. So 75 to the dollar feels like equilibrium, which suggests that there is further juice in playing the export story around IT and pharma.The slowdown in the lending has taken its toll on auto sales as well. This played out in December sales figures. Would you say that the worst is already priced in and is it time to start buying on dips, or maybe keep it to names like Bajaj Auto?It is not just the slowdown in lending, It is specifically the challenges facing the NBFC sector which have hit auto very hard. Because of the nature of their business model, the NBFCs are far more enthusiastic financiers of trucks, cars and bikes than the typical high street banks are. My reckoning is that NBFCs stay under the pump through this year. Whilst the worst of the IL&FS scare is behind us, there are reasons to believe that money will stay dear, cost of capital will stay high for the NBFCs and market share will shift to the banks. So, while the auto slowdown will abate as the year progresses, seeing 15%, 20% growth in truck volumes and 20% growth in car volumes is not something we should expect to see in 2019. That was a specific feature of the early part of 2018. It will probably go back to high single digits growth on cars and trucks but the high teens, early 20s numbers that we were seeing in car and truck volume growth will be a long time coming. This is year of a high single digit growth in auto volumes rather than double digit growth.You have been making a point, stick to the compounders’ list. In 2019, has there been any additions to your classic compounders list?Abbott Labs is a company we have been looking at quite carefully for a while. It seems to have all the classic characteristics of a great compounder, strong proprietary technology, proprietary IP, superb cash flows. It is a company we are looking at quite carefully, perhaps we will add it to our portfolio at some stage this year. The other element to think about is the fact that what you are seeing in largecap consistent compounders, firms like say HDFC Bank or Asian Paints and so on. There is a reasonable chance you can see the same phenomenon on getting repeated lower down the market caps spectrum. I think there is a good chance that well-run smallcaps can have a very good year. Raw material price pressure, raw material cost pressures have abated and that typically is a great time for smallcap stocks to see improvement in operating margins. So well-run smallcap companies will find 2019 to be a fertile year and we are spending a fair bit of time looking for consistent compounders down the market cap spectrum, well-run small cap companies with good franchises.We may hope to catch the next smallcap but in reality it is very difficult, isn’t it?There is a very peculiar feature in the Indian markets. The Sensex churns by around 25 to 30% over a 10-year period. But the BSE 500 churns by almost twice as much over a 10-year period. What that suggests is it is relatively easy for a well run smallcap company to enter the BSE 500, have a good four-five-year run where growth is say 20-25%. The companies enter the BSE 500 and then they struggle big time to get anywhere close to the Nifty. So our stock market is a play of two halves, on the one hand you have giants like Asian Paints and HDFC Bank with formidable competitive advantages cranking out huge shareholder returns over long periods of time and then you have well run small cap companies who are able to grow rapidly to a point but not beyond that. And in between these two extremities there is a sort of whole load of mediocrity which is basically the bulk of the BSE 500. My job in a way is to think one of the HDFC Bank and Asian Paints consistent compounders, great companies which can crank out superb returns over long periods of time but on the other hand, look out for promising small companies who can have a four-five-six-year run and end up dominating the small niche in the Indian economy. So I was referring to the smaller strategy of looking for companies which can dominate small niche in the Indian economy. They might never be an HDFC Bank or an Asian Paints but they will have a four-five-year good run and that is what I am trying to also discover, This is a good year for that because raw material prices have abated and that is typically a good climate for smaller companies to have a decent run.Where else within smallcaps do you find value? The other area to look at quite carefully is playing a capex recovery but rather than trying to do it through say an L&T type of construct or buying Axis Bank shares, one can look for B2B companies which will benefit from a revival in the capex construct in our country. To give an example, take a company like GMM Pfaudler, which makes glass line vessels. Their vessels are used by the chemical industry, the pharma industry and therefore if we have an economic revival and chemical demand spurts upm then GMM Pfaudler with experience should experience a revival in top line growth.Similarly, if you look at a company like Alkyl Amines which makes aliphatic amines, again if you have an industrial revival in our country a dominant supplier of a niche chemical could see a good run. So try to look for well run small cap companies which dominate a niche in our B2B economy and our industrial economy might be a more interesting way to play a potential capex recovery on the other side of the election rather than trying to buy the sort of the no-brainer type of stocks which is what the typical investor will run out to do.How would you be looking at the exporters this year? They were a big play into 2018 especially the IT stocks. How would they fare in 2019?IT remains a prominent part of my portfolio. I had turned bullish around 17-18 months ago and as you were just discussing in the early part of this interview, if the currency remains at 70 and perhaps goes towards 75 to a dollar, there is good reason to believe IT exporters will continue having a decent run in. I would add pharma to that list. A stock price recovery in pharma is long overdue. Domestic demand has been very robust for the last four, five years. The worst of the FDA action is behind us and if the currency stays at 70 or indeed moves towards 75, there is a long overdue recovery in Indian pharma stocks as well.We have seen a massive outperformance in the Nifty because of TCS and to a large extent Reliance. They have done well and there was a macro scare. This kind of factor played out in 2013 when rupee went down, crude was volatile, interest rates went higher. We saw a very strong rally in midcap and smallcap stocks. But now mid and smallcap valuations are not cheap. So will only experts like you be able to get few midcaps right? But but that is only 15% of the market?I am glad you brought this point out. I think there is two different ways in which you can think of a small and midcap rally; the first way the classic small and midcap rally in any market is typically when money becomes really cheap, cost of capital drops, everybody gets really excited, the animal spirits come out and people start looking for exciting small and midcap companies even though the fundamentals of these stocks might not be the greatest. I do not think 2019 is going to be a year for that sort of a rally. The cost of capital keeps going up in our country and maybe we will get the odd RBI rate hike before the election but by and large, the cost of capital globally will carry on grinding up and we too will be part of that journey and hence it would be difficult to see a small and midcap rally driven by risk appetite. The other reason that small and midcap companies can more selectively have a good run is their fundamentals improve either raw material prices abate or demand picks up a little bit and they see operating margin expansion. On the back of operating margin expansion you see selective small and midcaps rallying. I think this is more the latter sort of year, not the former sort of year. I find it difficult to believe that suddenly we will see cheap money sloshing around India and everybody will start having a punt at small and midcaps. It feels more like the latter sort of year where well run small and midcap companies have a good run on the back of better profitability, better profit margins in 2019.Will you buy two-wheelers if there is right now only gloom and doom in a Hero MotorCorp or Eicher Motors? If interest rates which is a raw material for consumer to buy cars and two-wheelers remains low, will auto demand come back?Let me answer the easier question first. FMCG is set for another good year, partly the demand base for FMCG is in good shape, election oriented spending and so on. But also raw material prices abating is good news for FMCG stocks. I know valuations are elevated there, but I do not think FMCG stocks will suffer on account of rich valuations. If I had to buy a two-wheeler stock, if someone held a gun to my head and said you have to have a two-wheeler stock, I would go for Bajaj because the export-oriented element of the Bajaj franchise puts it on a better wicket than Hero or indeed Eicher.If I had to buy a two-wheeler stock I would look at Bajaj. For a long time now, TVS Motors continues to be a company which has gone from strength to strength, their BMW bike is shaping up pretty well and I think TVS will continue to be an interesting stock to have. But amongst the frontline two-wheelers, if someone held a gun to my head, I will look at Bajaj Auto. The export franchise could be the main thing which draws investors towards them. The domestic piece on two-wheeler consumption will remain challenged as cost of money stays high in our country.

Congress demands answers from PM on Parrikar's purported claim on Rafale deal's file,Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala came out with a conversation purportedly between Goa minister Vishwajit Rane and another person.,"New Delhi: The Congress Wednesday demanded answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar's purported claim that he had a file on Rafale ""lying in his bedroom"" and asked if this was the reason why a joint parliamentary committee probe was not being ordered. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala came out with a conversation purportedly between Goa minister Vishwajit Rane and another person.  Rane purportedly can be heard saying that during a Goa cabinet meeting last week Parrikar stated he had an entire file and all documents relating to the Rafale deal lying in his bedroom, Surjewala claimed, playing the conversation for the media outside Parliament.  He quoted Rane as saying, ""The chief minister made a very interesting statement, that I have all the information of Rafale in my bedroom....that's means he is holding them to ransom. He said it is in my bedroom here only in my flat, each and every document on Rafale.""  However, there was no confirmation on whether it was the voice of Rane in the audio. The identity of the other person was also not ascertained.  The BJP has alleged that the Congress is only ""peddling lies"" on the Rafale issue.  ""Now it is clear that the 'chowkidaar is chor' (the watchman is a thief),"" Surjewala told reporters in an apparent reference to Modi.  ""Now the prime minister should answer. The country is demanding answers as to what secrets in the Rafale 'scam' are lying inside Manohar Parrikar's flat and bedroom,"" he claimed, asking why is the 'chowkidaar' fearing Parrikar.  ""Now the prime minister has to answer. He only does captive interviews and is not used to answering questions from the media. What is the hitch in making public all the documents,"" he asked.  Surjewala claimed the skeletons were tumbling out of the Rafale scam cupboard.  ""New evidence busts 'chowkidar's' worst kept secrets. What is Modi government hiding... Is this the reason why a JPC probe is not being ordered,"" he asked.  Training his guns on Modi, Surjewala said, ""this is a personal charge against you"".  ""There was corruption and wrongdoing in the Rafale scam and it is all recorded in the files. Those files are with Mr Parrikar. Why are they being hidden? If Mr Modi has nothing to hide, then why is Mr Parrikar keeping those files in his bedroom and threatening everybody that nobody can do anything against him, for he has the Rafale files,"" he alleged.  ""Because, secrets are all recorded in the files and the day those files are out, as stated by and threatened by Parrikar himself, then what we have always said will be proved. That Rafale is the biggest scam of India and the person accountable for it is the prime minister himself,"" he told reporters  He said it has now become necessary that the files of Rafale with Parrikar need to come out in public domain.","Jan 02, 2019, 12:29 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/congress-demands-answers-from-pm-on-parrikars-purported-claim-on-rafale-deals-file/articleshow/67345801.cms
A farm life shaped this Michelin star chef's opinion on food,Miguel Barrera Barrachina also says that an award-winning meal is a subjective thing. ,"Michelin star chef Miguel Barrera Barrachina says that an award-winning meal is a subjective thing. But there is one factor that can take you to the top: having a proper personality and being authentic.Barrachina says, “I greatly value a meal or restaurant which makes me feel at home straight away. I also think that the products need to be of the maximum quality and cooked using appropriate technique.”Barrachina grew up in a farm and that helped shape his opinion on food. “It helped me learn to value the importance of natural products in their habitat and to use what you have near. I always try to work with local products.” While he is adventurous when it comes to all types of cuisine, one of his favourite places to visit for its food is Japan. “Their gastronomy has integrity and honesty. They know how to market these characteristics very well,” he said. Anthony Bourdain: The Chef Who Courted ControversyAutoplay1 of 5Chef ExtraordinaireThe culinary world - and others included - sunk into collective depression on Friday after news broke of Anthony Bourdain's death. The celebrity chef was in France working on an upcoming episode of his CNN series. His friend, French chef Eric Ripert, found him unresponsive in his hotel room on Friday morning. The Perfect RecipeBourdain, seen here in pic with Italian actor and director Asia Argento for the Women In The World Summit in New York earlier in April this year, had a chequered journey. His walk of fame began in 2000 with the publication of “Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly.” Years of hard work in kitchens around Manhattan, and as executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles, finally paid off. The best-seller was hailed by critics for its witty, energetically written look behind-the-scenes of the restaurant industry. The book expanded on a 1999 New Yorker article that he had sent to The New Yorker about the underbelly of the restaurant world and its deceptions.A Moveable FeastBourdain followed up his literary success into a gig with Food Network hosting “A Cook’s Tour.” This happened to be his breakout moment with Bourdain’s signature programming approach — it followed the chef with the hangdog look, slightly hungover to exotic ports of call, trying out local cuisine and giving a sneak peek into foreign cultures.He repeated the concept on the Travel Channel’s “No Reservations” and “The Layover”, both successful shows that aired from 2005 to 2013. No BoundariesAnthony Bourdain seen here with the outstanding informational series or special award for 'Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown' backstage at the 2015 Creative Arts Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. As part of the show, Bourdain ate grilled pork and noodles with President Barack Obama in Hanoi, examined the legacy of apartheid in Johannesburg, dug into pig ear sandwiches in the Mississippi Delta, and experienced the harvest festival, Gawai Dayak, in Borneo. It was in Borneo that Bourdain was asked and complied with a request from villagers to plunge a spear into the heart of a pig!Courting ControversyBourdain was never too far from controversies. Apart from being admonished by some for cultural invasion, he was recently declared ""persona non grata for his disrespect of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and sovereignty."" The Foreign Ministry spokesman of Azerbaijan told Agence France-Presse. ""Filming a food show on Azerbaijan's occupied territory is an insult to one million Azerbaijani refugees who were forcefully expelled from their homes.""

"Will gold shine in 2019? It will, but not as much as you want",,"By Gnanasekar ThiagarajanGold prices are set to rise next year as the US Federal Reserve slows the pace of interest rate hikes. Yet, we do not expect the yellow metal to run away on the upside, as the economy will remain strong.Demand for gold should be strong in the first quarter due to seasonal factors, tied to buying around celebrations in key gold-consuming nations like India and China like the Chinese New year and Indian festivals, which underpin prices.Gold should benefit in many ways if US economic growth and monetary tightening slows. An end to rate hikes may stem the rise in the US dollar, which can help gold as the metal moves inversely against the greenback. If interest rates are not going to go up as much as expected, that is going to weigh on the dollar. And if US growth slows, that will weigh on the dollar too. We don’t expect the dollar to decline sharply, but these factors will be key headwinds for the US currency.The stock market may largely stay sideways next year, which may support gold and silver demand. So far this quarter, gold has crushed the market, giving more than 5 per cent as of December 18, compared with negative 11.9 per cent return on the S&P500 Index.So, what is expected to limit the upside?While economic growth may slow, it will still remain healthy overall. That will hold down any safe-haven buying. We do expect prices to rise on the back of a falling dollar, but just don’t expect investors to go crazy buying gold next year, as equity market hangover from high returns over the past years have dented the appeal of precious metals.There has been a noticeable slowdown in traditional physical buying in India, due to various factors, ranging from a change in preference of the younger generation, who are more credit savvy and give less importance to savings.However, the pace of investment buying may very well pick up in 2020 and 2021. December has historically been a strong month for stocks. But fears of a slowdown in global growth, rising interest rates and the US-China trade tensions have prompted many investors to pare down their equity holdings in favour of gold, often perceived as safe haven in times of economic and financial instability.It can be gauged from the change in stance in the speculative net long positions of funds, which have turned positive for the first time since July 2018.Technical PictureThe chart patterns are quite positive and are hinting at strength in the coming months. In the past three years post Fed rate hikes, gold has rallied, and it might not be an exception this year too.We expect $1,350 (MCX: Rs 34,000) to be an important cap on the upside, where a strong resistance lies. The bullish view could get negated, if prices were to break the $1,200 (MCX: Rs 30,500) level on the downside, which is not our favoured view.(Gnanasekar Thiagarajan is Director at Commtrendz Research.

Jet Airways delays loan repayments to banks,"​For the first 90 days, the lenders would discuss with Jet and monitor the loans checking whether it becomes a non performing asset (in other words if the credit has soured).","Jet Airways has delayed loan repayments as on December 31, the airline said late Tuesday, revealing the most serious issue yet highlighting the beleagured airline’s constantly failing financial health.“..the payment of interest and principal instalment due to the consortium of Indian banks (led by State Bank of India) on 31st December 2018 has been delayed due to temporary cashflow mismatch and the company has engaged with them in relation to the same,” India’s second biggest airline by market share said in a late night filing to the exchanges.The period for which Jet has delayed repayments couldn’t be immediately ascertained.A person close to the development said this will likely land Jet in the 180 day cycle of loan restructuring according to the latest RBI rules.The rules announced on Feb 12, abolished all earlier debt rejig mechanisms and put in place a stringent 180-day timeline post even one day of default, at the end of which the company is put under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code if the debt issue hasn’t been resolved by then.For the first 90 days, the lenders would discuss with Jet and monitor the loans checking whether it becomes a non performing asset (in other words if the credit has soured). That happening, lenders would for the subsequent 90 days try to restructure the debt, failing which the airline is put under IBC.This is the latest and most serious issue that underlines the economic crisis facing Jet. The airline has delayed salaries, laid off staff, grounded planes and pruned flights. It has been trying to coax strategic partner Etihad Airways to buy more stake in the carrier, but the Gulf airline won’t budge unless it get’s chairman founder Naresh Goyal’s controlling stake. Goyal isn’t willing to cede. Etihad owns 24% in Jet.Jet has also proposed to SBI and the lending consortium for liquidity assistance and alternatively to convert its loans to equity. The lenders have said they wont provide any assistance until Jet’s founders and shareholders put in cash into the airline.","Jan 02, 2019, 12:16 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/jet-airways-delays-loan-repayments-to-banks/articleshow/67345965.cms
Transport dept to issue new auto permits after 7 yrs in Bengaluru,"The regional transport authority has also allowed issuance of permits to 5,000 electric autorickshaws to encourage eco-friendly transport.","BENGALURU: Bengaluru could get 5,000 electric and 5,000 CNG autorickshaws by the end of March. The decision to issue new permits to autorickshaws — the last permits were issued in 2011 — was taken last week. As many as 500 permits in each category are reserved for women. “Permits will be issued to autorickshaw drivers on a firstcome-first-served basis,” said Vijay Shankar BM, chairman of the regional transport authority, who is also deputy commissioner of Bengaluru urban district. Over the next five years, the authority plans to issue permits for another 25,000 LPG/CNG autorickshaws. The decision comes on the back of the previous Siddaramaiahled state government’s budgetary promise of issuing permits to 30,000 autorickshaws.The regional transport authority has also allowed issuance of permits to 5,000 electric autorickshaws to encourage eco-friendly transport. The BBMP will also provide a subsidy of `80,000 for women who want to buy an autorickshaw. A large number of unemployed youths are expected to apply for the permits.Welcoming the decision, M Manjunath, president of Aadarsh Auto and Taxi Drivers Union, said the new permits will end the sale of permits illegally and at a much higher cost. “Brokers are selling transfer permits for a price of `70,000. The actual cost of a permit is just `500. With the new decision, many can afford to buy an autorickshaw as it gives a steady income. It creates job opportunities,” he said. Manjunath said the authority was sitting on the proposal for several months even though the government had notified it in March. “The authority held meetings only after we approached the high court. It’s a victory for the autorickshaw drivers,” he said. Data shows over 1.94 lakh autorickshaws are registered in Bengaluru although the transport department has issued only 1.25 lakh permits. The gap between the number of registrations and permits is attributed to various factors: use of autorickshaws outside the city limits; and transfer of permits from old vehicles to new ones, loss of documents, etc. Transport commissioner VP Ikkeri said autorickshaws with two-stroke engines will be banned by 2020. “There are about 20,000 two-stroke autos in the city. The government has provided a subsidy of `30,000 if the owners either scrap or convert their vehicles to electric rickshaws. But there is not much demand (for the subsidy),” he said. He explained the much-delayed ban thus: “We are not forcing autorickshaw drivers as the livelihood of many completely depends on the vehicle. We will slowly phase out (two-strokes).”","Jan 02, 2019, 12:17 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/transport-dept-to-issue-new-auto-permits-after-7-yrs-in-bengaluru/articleshow/67345560.cms
Green tax relief to only those vehicles that have RFID tag,"Three years ago, the Supreme Court had introduced the ECC (environment compensation charge) for the largely commercial goods vehicles.","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 02, 2019)NEW DELHI: In a bid to make the ambitious Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) toll project successful, EPCA has directed the municipal corporations to give environment tax exemption incentive to only those vehicles that have RFID tags.A senior south corporation official from the toll tax department said the new system would come into force from January 3 at eight toll plazas where RFID systems are in place. These border points include Aya Nagar, DND Flyway, Shahdara main, Shahdara flyover, Tikri border, Kapashera border, Rajokri border and Kundli border.Three years ago, the Supreme Court had introduced the ECC (environment compensation charge) for the largely commercial goods vehicles while exempting those carrying essential items like milk, petroleum, fruits and vegetables. “Vehicles exempted under any category must now get pre- registered at the PoS counters established near the toll plazas and obtain RFID tags to get exemption. This is how we are incentivising it,” an official said.The civic bodies had set up the target of selling at least 2 lakh RFID tags, but so far only around 2,500 vehicles have pre-registered. “RFID infrastructure is ready at many points, but since a very low number of vehicles have RFID tags and most of the transactions are taking place in cash, the original purpose of reducing congestion with free movement of vehicles and automatic toll deduction is being defeated,” the official explained.By linking it with ECC exemption, the corporations are hoping to enrol a large number of trucks in RFID regime. “Since the same trucks carry essential goods and other items during different trips, this step will help us cover a large number of goods vehicles,” the official added. Vehicles over 10 years old won’t be registered or allowed to enter Delhi. The 13 border points chosen for the RFID project receive 85% of the traffic.","Jan 02, 2019, 12:19 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/green-tax-relief-to-only-those-vehicles-that-have-rfid-tag/articleshow/67346030.cms
Most Asian currencies decline as factory activity fizzles,​​The  rupee and the Malaysian ringgit also retreated after softer manufacturing readings.,"Most Asian currencies fell on Wednesday, shrugging off broad US dollar weakness as gloomy factory surveys added to worries about cooling regional and global growth. A private survey showed manufacturing in China, the world's second-largest economy, contracted for the first time in 19 months in December as domestic and export orders continue to weaken. Factory activity also shrank in South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, while Singapore reported much slower fourth-quarter economic growth than expected. China's economy is expected to slow further in coming quarters, adding to pressure on other Asian exporters, Mizuho bank said in a note. Leading declines in the region, the Indonesia rupiah dropped 0.7 per cent to 14,475.00 per dollar. The currency weakened about 6 per cent against the greenback in 2018. The Korean won faltered 0.3 per cent, while the Taiwan dollar also softened after weak manufacturing reports. The Indian rupee and the Malaysian ringgit also retreated after softer manufacturing readings. Bucking the trend, the Thai baht strengthened 0.7 per cent to 32.40 per dollar. Thailand's monetary policy committee expects any future policy tightening would be gradual, minutes from its last policy meeting showed on Wednesday. The Bank of Thailand raised rates by 25 basis points in December, its first rate hike since 2011, to curb risks to financial stability. Also firming against the dollar was the Chinese yuan and the Philippine peso. The yuan strengthened on the first trading day of the new year, supported by a firmer official yuan midpoint reflecting broad weakness in the US dollar. Traders said weaker manufacturing readings had been expected. The dollar dipped as one of the region's most stable economies begins to feel the impact of trade frictions between the United States and China. The city-state reported fourth-quarter economic growth that was about half as strong as expected after the manufacturing sector shrank.

Farm loan waiver has an unlikely victim: Liquor firms,,"By Ameya KarveA spate of political promises of waivers on farm-loan repayments in Indian states has an unlikely victim: alcohol companies.States are expected to hike taxes on liquor -- one of the top three revenue sources -- as they need to plug the fiscal hole arising from bearing the burden of farm-loan repayments.

Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was voted out in three key states last month by the Indian National Congress -- the main national opposition -- which immediately announced the waiver program after forming governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.Raising liquor taxes -- which bring in nearly 25 percent of revenue -- is the most likely option as state governments are unlikely to borrow and worsen their debt to GDP ratios, Abneesh Roy and Alok Shah, analysts at Edelweiss wrote in an investor note Jan. 1. “In the past, there have been multiple instances where volumes have taken a beating owing to price hikes emanating from an increase in the tax rate,” they wrote. Bloomberg Maharashtra increased the tax on Indian-made liquor by 20 percent from Tuesday, the Times of India reported, citing a bureaucrat it didn’t name.

How to make money from mutual funds in 2019,Mutual funds sahi hai: Nobody doubts the veracity of the statement.,"Mutual funds sahi hai: Nobody doubts the veracity of the statement. Mutual funds have indeed proved that they are common investors’ best friend -- when it comes to achieving various financial goals. The new year is not any different. Even though many investors are concerned about a host of overseas and domestic factors, especially the upcoming parliamentary elections, they know that they must stick to their financial plans to achieve their financial goals. Here are some pointers that might help you to make money in 2019.Ignore predictionsPundits can’t help making predictions every new year. It is a different matter how many of those predictions really come true. You might come across many advices like stick to largecaps; ignore smallcaps; time to nibble midcaps etc. You must learn to ignore the noise. You should remind yourself that these advice are general in nature – they are not specific to your needs.Only you or your mutual fund advisor would know about your financial goals and your investment plans. The talking head has no clue about them. The expert may be making those comments based on the prevailing market conditions or new developments in the market. These factors are unlikely to have a long-term impact on your investments. So, learn to ignore the noise and stay focused on your goals.Don’t fear volatilityWhen there are many uncertainties hovering around the horizon, the market is likely to remain listless. The fear of slowdown overseas and the upcoming parliamentary election are likely to contribute to the volatility in the market. If the election result is not in line with expectations, it might add to the volatility. Any setback to the current ruling party or a hung parliament may further add to the chaos.How do you keep your cool? Well, you should know that the market is unpredictable. For example, an unexpected election result or setback need not result in predictable reaction. The market may ignore it, or it would react violently, but it is not easy to predict it. All you could do is to remind yourself that the stock market can be volatile, but it would deliver in the long term.Don’t be adventurousWhat if things suddenly improve? For example, the current government is voted back to power and suddenly there is optimism all around you. Don’t get swayed by widespread optimism and rocketing indices and take unnecessary risks. The widespread positive sentiment may lift the battered midcap and smallcap stocks or some sectors may jump – that need not be the reason for you to join the party. Stick to your allocations and investment plans.The market sentiment is something you can’t predict – it may not react negatively to some bad news or it may not react positively to some good news. So, it is always better to keep your distance from the market – be aloof to changing sentiments.Be sure about your plansMost investors tend to get nervous during a bleak period because they are unsure of their plans and choices. For example, etmutualfunds.com official Facebook receives many messages from readers looking for reassurances: they want to know whether they have planned it right or chosen right schemes, etc.Visit your mutual fund advisor at regular intervals – talk with him about your concerns and clear your doubts. If you are a DIY investor, brush up your basics, take a re-look at your investment plans and choices. Just ensure that everything is according to your plan. Don’t treat this task lightly – it will go a long way in offering you the confidence in times of uncertainties in the market.Stick to your plansOnce you are sure about your plans, you should stick to it. You might have come across the phrase so many times in your investment life, but that doesn’t mean you should doubt its value. Ask your mutual fund advisor, financial planner or mutual fund manager, each of them would tell you that you should stick to your investment plan if you want to achieve your financial goals. Do not let anything change your plan – unless there is an earth-shattering event that changes everything.","Jan 11, 2019, 04:42 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/how-to-make-money-from-mutual-funds-in-2019/articleshow/67346342.cms

However, that act lasted a couple of minutes, before the academy was shocked to see the elderly couple suddenly smash at every shot, leaving the trainees in awe.

Mutual fund advisors share investment tips for 2019,Mutual fund advisors believe that 2019 is going to be a volatile year for equity mutual fund investors.,"Mutual fund advisors believe that 2019 is going to be a volatile year for equity mutual fund investors. General elections in India, Brexit, fear of a recession in the United States and many other international factors are going to be at play in this New Year. Mutual fund advisors are asking their clients to invest safely and follow these golden rules:Babu Krishnamoortrhy, Chief Sherpa at Finsherpa Financial Advisors, Chennai:Keep an eye on your portfolio but don’t switch from your schemes frequently. 2019 will be volatile but investors shouldn’t take actions on every bout of volatility. Review your portfolio right now and then continue with your mix. Stick to your percentage allocation and don’t stop your investments.Vishal Dhawan, Founder, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors, Mumbai:I think investors should look at international funds this year. Allocation to international markets will help them when the markets in India go down. Having said this, I suggest investors to not allocate large portions to these funds. These schemes should be for diversification in your portfolio. Investors should look at their entire portfolio rather than just concentrating in equities.Vivekh Pathak, Founder, Finance and You, Delhi:2019 looks better placed than 2018 but it will be volatile. I will offer only one advice: don’t stop your SIPs. Continue investing in a systematic manner, that’s your best bet for equity investments in 2019. Elections are around the corner and we might see the market either going down drastically or going up for a while. In both the scenarios, investors should keep calm because the change will be temporary. Just sit back and continue investing.Ankur Maheshwari, CEO - Equirus Wealth, Mumbai:I will suggest investors to stay true to their asset allocation. We saw markets correcting in 2018 which means your equity allocation must have gone down. Invest more in equities even when the market is volatile. This will get you back to your planned asset allocation. Don’t take tactical calls if you don’t want to take risk. Your asset allocation should be in line with your risk profile. Stick to the basics and you will be fine.","Jan 03, 2019, 11:36 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/mutual-fund-advisors-share-investment-tips-for-2019/articleshow/67346456.cms
Ending country cap in Green Cards may allow India to dominate path to US citizenship: Report,Having a Green Card allows a person to live and work permanently in the United States of America.,"WASHINGTON: Eliminating the country quota from the most sought-after Green Cards will end the current discrimination in the US labour market, but would allow countries like India and China to dominate the path to American citizenship, according to the latest Congressional report.Having a Green Card allows a person to live and work permanently in the United States.Indian-Americans, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the US mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system which imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of Green Cards or the Legal Permanent Residency (LPR).The bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), an independent research wing of Congress, said if the per-country cap for employment-based immigrants was removed, many expects that Indian and Chinese nationals would dominate the flow of new employment-based LPRs for as many years as needed to clear out the accumulated queue of prospective immigrants from those countries.This queue would include those with approved employment-based immigrant petitions waiting to file either a visa application with Department of State or an adjustment of status application with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the CRS said in its latest report.The CRS regularly prepares reports on various issues for the lawmakers to take informed decisions.A copy of the report 'Permanent Employment-Based Immigration and the Per-country Ceiling' dated December 21 was made available to PTI, ahead of the new Congress beginning January 3, wherein several lawmakers are planning to introduce a legislation to eliminate per-country quota for issuing Green Cards to foreign nationals.As of April 2018, a total of 306,601 Indian nationals – mostly IT professionals – were waiting in line for Green Cards, according to the USCIS figures.Indians constitute 78 per cent of the 395,025 foreign nationals waiting for Green Cards in just one category of employment-based LPR applications.Due to the cap, the current wait period for the majority of Indians to get a Green Card is nine and half years, the CRS said, adding this could increase or decrease further depending on the number of new applications every year. India is followed by China with 67,031 in line for Green Cards.Lawmakers favouring eliminating the per-country cap contend that such circumstances effectively encourage employers to sponsor prospective employment-based immigrants primarily from India.Proponents argue that removing the per-country ceiling from employment-based immigrants would ""level the playing field"" by making immigrants from all countries more equally attractive to employers, the CRS said.According to the CRS, eliminating the per-country ceiling would reduce certain queues of prospective immigrants more quickly, and remove the perceived employer incentive to choose nationals from these countries over other countries.""Shorter wait times for LPR status might actually incentivise greater numbers of nationals from India, China and the Philippines to seek employment-based LPR status. If that were to occur, the reduction in the number of approved petitions pending might be short-lived.""A handful of countries could conceivably dominate employment-based immigration, possibly benefitting certain industries that employ foreign workers from those countries, at the expense of foreign workers from other countries and other industries that might employ them,"" the CRS said.Because the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) grants LPRs the ability to sponsor family members through its family-sponsorship provisions, removing the per-country ceiling would alter, to an unknown extent, the country-of-origin composition of subsequent family-based immigrants acquiring LPR status each year, it said.Changes in the country's demographic profile tilted towards people from one part of the world, was one of the prime reasons for the current per country quota. This, on the other hand, restricts the flow of the best talented foreign workers.The INA allocates 140,000 visas annually for all five employment-based LPR categories, roughly 12 per cent of the 1.1 million LPRs admitted in fiscal 2017. It further limits each immigrant-sending country to an annual maximum of seven per cent of all employment-based LPR admissions, known as the per-country ceiling, or ""cap"".Two popular employment-based pools of foreign nationals, who have been approved as employment-based immigrants but must wait for statutorily limited visa numbers, totalled in excess of 900,000 as of mid-2018. Most originate from India, followed by China and the Philippines, the CRS said.Some employers maintain that they continue to need skilled foreign workers to remain internationally competitive and to keep their firms in the US, it said.Proponents of increasing employment-based immigration levels argue it is vital for economic growth. Opponents cite the lack of compelling evidence of labour shortages and argue that the presence of foreign workers can negatively impact wages and working conditions in the US, the CRS said.""Some argue that eliminating the per-country ceiling would increase the flow of high-skilled immigrants from countries such as India and China, who are often employed in the US technology sector, without increasing the total annual admission of employment-based LPRs,"" it added.","Jan 03, 2019, 06:05 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/visa-and-immigration/ending-country-cap-in-green-cards-may-allow-india-china-to-dominate-path-to-us-citizenship-report/articleshow/67346383.cms
"Thanks to e-commerce policy change, there is a level playing field: Kishore Biyani, Future Group","
We would be looking at collaborating with multiple players, says Group CEO, Future Group ","Maybe in two, three years time, nobody will talk of online and offline; they will be talked together, Kishore          Biyani, Group CEO, Future Group, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:How might the policy change in the business model of some of the large e-commerce operators boost the likes of retailers such as yourself? The policy saw one of the best clarifications from the government because there were rules which talked about marketplace B2B business and doing retail business was in circumvention of that policy, an ambiguity, which in some way people were taking advantage of. This brings an end to people doing retail business which was the intent of the policy for a long period of time. We are very happy that there is a level playing field. There is a policy clarity. Why cannot we build our own Indian Alibaba or Indian Amazon? I do not know why we are so enamoured by the international players. Does this move by the government impact your discussion with a potential e-commerce giant? Does it give you more bargaining power? I would say we are looking at a collaborative approach of doing things and we believe we have a created interesting infrastructure in the country in terms of operating out of 355 towns, having our own value chain management, having our own supply chain, having our own physical retail stores, data, the multiple things. We believe if we can align with somebody, we can grow much faster. There is always a collaborative way of working which I believe will continue to happen and we would be looking at how we can collaborate with multiple players to do multiple things to excite our customers and make products reach at a much faster speed to the consumer. The Indian retail sector saw some interesting events and changes also. Experts believe this sector is at an inflexion point and could go substantial in 2019. Do you agree with that? How do you see Future Group grow in 2019? Retail is always an exciting play. I personally believe retail always be exciting because every day is a new day. Customers are changing, products are changing, categories are emerging. There are new ways of doing business. Technology has come into play. Data is coming into play. So business is probably more exciting than ever. Yes there is so much of opportunity in India because India is a country of 1.3 billion people with aspirations rising, affluence rising, infrastructure getting created, lot of new categories getting formed. As one of the players in the market, we are more excited because of the opportunity which lies ahead of us since we have built a whole business around managing the entire value chain and building infrastructure to manage the scale and complexity of this business. In India, grocery accounts for 62% of the total revenue but the store based retails have captured only 3% of the opportunity and online penetration is not even half a per cent. Could this be the story for 2019 and could this be the story for Future Retail also? We operate in more than 355 cities and around 8,000-9,000 rural towns. We have a large distribution base. We have plans to open 10,000 small stores over the period of next seven years. We are currently opening around two-three stores a day and our effort is to make grocery a very important part of our business. Since we have lot of our own manufacturing, nearly 40 manufacturing units which we have set up, food parks in Bangalore and Nagpur and more coming up, For us grocery is an important play but it is 35% to 40% of our food business. We believe as we go forward with lots of small stores coming up, the percentage of grocery might increase.","Jan 02, 2019, 01:29 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/thanks-to-e-commerce-policy-change-there-is-a-level-playing-field-kishore-biyani-future-group/articleshow/67346529.cms
"Outlook 2019: Crude going through rebalancing, baseline support at $50-55","Brent crude hit a high of $86 in October, and later cracked towards the $56 mark in Dec.","By Navneet DamaniCrude oil has corrected by over 35 per cent in last three months sliding to the lowest in 15 months. Until October 2018, it looked like crude oil would be the best bet for the year with over 30 per cent gains, but it all evaporated within no time, closing the year in the red.Brent crude hit a high of $86 in October, and later cracked towards the $56 mark in December – all due credit to the US which announced change of plans over Iran sanctions.Prices witnessed a huge correction and continued to fall on growing concerns over China-US trade tensions, as a weaker emerging economic outlook raised worries over global economic and oil demand growth outlook. Buildup of huge crude inventories in the US, which have been rising for last six consecutive weeks, also contributed to the bearish bias.Opec tried to support prices, by clinching a deal with allied oil-producing nations, including Russia, at its headquarters in Vienna, agreeing to take 1.2 million barrels a day off the market in the first six months of 2019. The 15-member Opec cartel has agreed to reduce its output by 800,000 bpd, while Russia and the allied producers will cut some 400,000 bpd.Russia will reduce production by 2 per cent from its October output of 11.4 million bpd, equalling about 228,000-230,000 bpd.Supply sufficiencyGlobal oil supplies are growing rapidly, as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US are pumping at record levels, holding supply above 100 mb a day even as Iran’s output has tumbled due to US sanctions and as others posted further losses.Saudi Arabia’s production hit an all-time high of 11.3 million barrel a day in Q3, but signalled the markets an export cut of 0.5 million barrel a day in December due to lower seasonal demand. Along with that, US crude production rose to 11.7 million barrels, surpassing Russia in Q3.Next year, need for Opec oil is expected to reduce due to relentless growth in non-Opec supplies, especially in the US.Overall, the supply side remains a major concern for the market as the troika of the US, Saudi and Russia account for 36 million barrels per day of crude and condensates production in 2018, which is 39 per cent of global total, compared with just 27 million bpd from the rest of Opec (30 per cent of global total).The main theme for next year will be how Opec plans to reduce supply glut to bring stability in prices.Demand outstripping supply consistentlyThe outlook for crude demand remains largely unchanged at 1.3 million barrels a day for 2018 and 1.4 million barrels a day in 2019. Both European and OECD Asian demand continues to be relatively weak, reflecting the fact that prices remain significantly higher than a year ago thanks to a slowdown in economic activity.US demand, by contrast, is very robust, albeit slowing towards the end of Q3CY18. Total OECD demand is expected to increase by 355 kb/d in 2018, with growth slowing to 285 kb/d in 2019.For China, the overall outlook for 2019 remains slightly skewed to the downside, as oil demand in 2019 is forecast to increase only by 0.34 mb/d, as trade tensions with the US are likely to continue.Demand declined by 4 kb/d YoY, although Q318 growth is estimated to have been 130 kb/d above last year’s level. India’s demand seemed to be growing at slower pace due to higher prices. India’s oil demand rose by only 155 kb/d YoY in Q3CY18 following growth of 300 kb/d in H118.OutlookThe oil market turned from being an oversupply market to a balanced one in December after Opec decision to cut output by 1.2 million barrels.Yet, the market seems to be bit nervous as the demand remains lower. The output cut spells opportunities – but also risks. The 1.2mmb/d cut fails to convince the market that oversupply is under control.The most important factor will be compliance for all countries and how Iranian sanction waivers pan out over next six months. It will provide a lot of clarity for US independent upstream producers going into the budgeting season of 2019. The Opec announcement provided a baseline support to oil between $50 and $55. That’s a decent level for US independent producers.To sum up, the process of rebalancing has started following Opec cuts and we believe rebalancing is now well and truly underway. WTI crude oil price saw the sharpest quarterly fall since 2014, declining over 33% during the quarter gone by. The medium-term bias for WTI crude continues to remain negative as long as it is below the $54-55 range. The current decline could extend towards $44-42 levels. Amidst all the uncertainties surrounding WTI crude oil market, a decisive move above/below the $55-42 could lead to extended price action in that direction.Our expectations are largely on the back of consistently lower Opec supplies during past few months while demand continues to remain weak.(Navneet Damani is Vice-president for Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

India's retaliatory tariffs to hit US exports worth USD 900 mn: Congressional report,"India ranked third as a destination for US apple exports in 2017, purchasing USD 97 million of US apples, or 10 per cent of the total exports.","WASHINGTON: India's proposed retaliatory tariffs against US agricultural products including apples, almonds and lentils will have an adverse impact on American exports worth nearly USD 900 million, according to the latest Congressional report.India last year announced higher import duties on many US products like apples, almonds, walnuts, chickpeas and lentils in retaliation to President Donald Trump's decision to impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items, a move that sparked fears of a global trade war.However, India is the only major country which has been continuously postponing the implementation of the retaliatory tariffs despite announcing it more than six months ago.In October last year, Trump described India as a ""tariff king"" as he reiterated his allegations that New Delhi has a high tariff rate on various American products.India's proposed retaliatory tariffs are far less than that by China on more than 800 American agricultural products which accounted for approximately USD 20.6 billion in exports to the US in 2017.China is followed by Canada (USD 2.6 billion), Mexico (USD 2.5 billion), the European Union (EU) (USD 1 billion) and Turkey (USD 250 million) in slapping retaliatory tariffs on the agricultural products from the US.Countries have imposed tariffs on American agricultural products to retaliate against actions the Trump administration took in March, 2018 to protect US steel and aluminum producers and in response to Chinese intellectual property rights and technology policies.Since then, over 800 US food and agricultural products have been subject to retaliatory tariffs from China, the EU, Turkey, Canada and Mexico, the bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in its report 'Profiles and Effects of Retaliatory Tariffs on US Agricultural Exports'.The CRS, an independent research wing of Congress, regularly prepares reports on various issues for the lawmakers to take informed decisions.US exports of those products to the retaliating countries totaled USD 26.9 billion in 2017, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) export data.It all started on March 23, 2018, when the Trump administration applied a 25 per cent tariff to all US steel imports and a 10 per cent tariff to all US aluminum imports, citing an investigation that showed national security concerns.""Canada, China, Mexico, the EU and Turkey retaliated with tariffs on imports of US agricultural and food products and other goods.""India has proposed retaliatory tariffs on US apples, almonds, walnuts, chickpeas and lentils, but it has delayed implementation pending ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration,"" said the CRS.Reports of CRS are prepared by independent experts for the lawmakers to make informed decisions and are not an official position of the US Congress.In its report dated December 31, the CRS sad in response to the tariffs the Trump administration levied on US imports of steel and aluminum from India earlier this year, India has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on a handful of US agricultural and food products. The date for imposing these tariffs has been pushed back several times, and they are currently set to become effective on January 31, 2019.""US exports of the targeted products were valued at USD 857 million in 2017, comprising 54 per cent of the USD 1.8 billion of total US agricultural exports to India. US almond growers, in particular, could feel the effects of India's threatened tariffs should they enter into force,"" said the CRS, a copy of which was obtained by PTI.India ranked third as a destination for US apple exports in 2017, purchasing USD 97 million of US apples, or 10 per cent of the total exports.""The Indian government proposes to apply a 30 per cent retaliatory tariff on imports of US apples on January 31, 2019,"" the CRS said. Comparatively, US apple exports to Mexico and China are now subject to additional retaliatory tariffs of 20 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, raising the total tariff rates to 20 per cent and 50 per cent respectively.The Trump administration has taken measures to ease the downside effects of the retaliatory tariffs on farmers and ranchers through a USD 12 billion trade aid package.Under the initiative, USDA has committed to making direct payments to farmers of selected commodities subject to the tariffs, as well as buying up surplus quantities of some commodities and providing funding for additional trade promotion efforts.India's exports to the US in 2017-18 stood at USD 47.9 billion, while imports were USD 26.7 billion. The trade balance is in favour of India.","Jan 02, 2019, 01:17 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/indias-retaliatory-tariffs-to-hit-us-exports-worth-usd-900-mn-congressional-report/articleshow/67346840.cms
Sydney win will be great achievement as team started transition here: Virat Kohli,Virat Kohli said winning the final Test would be like stepping up another notch in pursuit of consistency.,"History doesn't matter to him, asserts India skipper Virat Kohli but says winning a maiden Test series in Australia at the SCG would ""definitely be big"" because that's where the transition started for the team under his captaincy.Kohli took over as India's Test captain four years ago at the same venue after M S Dhoni's shock retirement.Ranked 7th at that point, India are now world No.1 in the format and have retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after taking an unassailable 2-1 lead in the four-Test series.""It's only been four years (since I have been a captain). If it happens, it's great because I have come here the third time on a Test tour and I know how difficult it is to win here,"" Kohli said on the eve of the fourth and final Test starting Thursday.""... at times, you can put in a good performance in Australia but to win as a team has been the biggest challenge for us. Individual performances, honestly, are something that you don't even remember in the last two tours,"" he stressed.Kohli said winning the final Test would be like stepping up another notch in pursuit of consistency.""You might have your name up on the honours board but if your team doesn't win, it doesn't really matter. Till now it would definitely be a big, big series' win, not just for me, but also for the whole team purely because of the fact that this is place where we started our transition to be honest,"" he explained.""At this particular venue when MS Dhoni gave up captaincy (2014) and we had a totally young side starting at six or seven (Test ranking) in the world. We have come back here as the number one side in the world, and we want to take that legacy forward.""Kohli said India will take the fourth and final Test as a standalone match and intensity won't be lacking.""Our year ended very well and we will try to make sure that we start this year well too. We are taking this as a standalone Test, which we must play with full intensity and effort,"" Kohli said.""We have seen in the past that the SCG wicket is good for batting for the first 2-3 days and after that reverse-swing and spin come into play. I think given the heat, the wicket will play to its true nature from day three onwards.""Kohli said his team is ""obsessed"" about winning.""If you see after the last wicket fell in the last game everyone's emotions came out, even the quietest guys... Because we understand that as a team when you push in one direction, things go well. And it has to be an obsession,"" he said.""If it is an obsession it won't stop at 1-2 games. If it's something that was a goal, then it stops at one or two games.""But Kohli said history doesn't matter and every one in the team is just simply focused on the job at hand.""If you ask me very honestly, no (history doesn't matter). We need to stay in the present and focus on the things we can do,"" he said.""The reason why we want to win this Test is we understand as cricketers how difficult it is to come here and play. It's not only the team you are playing against, it's the whole nation.""Kohli will become the most successful India captain away from home if his team can seal the series 3-1 but he said there is nothing to prove to anyone.""It's got nothing to do with proving that we want to do something that has never been done in the past. Every (Indian) team that comes here wants to win, obviously. I am sure that they would have had the same intention but the motivation has never been to change history,"" he said.""...not necessarily proving something to someone or changing history. It's just crossing a hurdle and making yourself believe that you are good enough to be at this level and beat any team anywhere in the world,"" Kohli said.The India skipper said wining at Melbourne has strengthened the team.""Victory in MCG has just solidified the belief we had as a team...I think wins like MCG and Adelaide only make you feel, as a team, that you're heading in the right direction.""

Australian shares kick off 2019 in the red on weak China factory survey,"The ""big four"" banks fell between 1.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent. ","Australian shares ended lower on Wednesday on the first trading day of the year as a disappointing Chinese manufacturing survey raised concerns about the health of the world's second largest economy and Australia's largest trading partner. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 1.6 per cent lower at 5,557.8. The benchmark ended 0.1 per cent lower on Monday and was closed for the New Year's Day public holiday on Tuesday. Broader Asian risk sentiment soured after a private sector survey showed China's factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in December, as domestic conditions and export orders weakened. This follows global equities' run lower last year, weighed by concerns about Sino-US trade tensions and sluggish global economic growth. Despite occasional relief, such as US President Donald Trump's ""long and very good call"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping over the weekend, uncertainty about a definite resolution to the trade war continues to cloud investor sentiment. Financial stocks and miners led the main benchmark lower, with the sector sub-indexes giving up 2 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively. The ""big four"" banks fell between 1.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent. The financial index was among the worst hit in 2018 after a national inquiry into the sector led to a massive selloff among Australian banks. Global miners BHP Group Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd slid 1.6 per cent and 2.3 per cent, respectively, with China concerns weighing down copper prices. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was closed on Wednesday for a public holiday.

"Rajya Sabha proceedings disrupted due to protests by AIADMK, DMK",The AIADMK members trooped into the Well of the House and raised slogans demanding justice.,"Rajya Sabha saw repeated adjournments on Wednesday morning as AIADMK and DMK members protested over the Cauvery river dam issue while many Congress MPs raised slogans for a JPC probe into the Rafale fighter jet deal.  The AIADMK members trooped into the Well of the House and raised slogans demanding justice. The Tamil Nadu parties are protesting against the proposed Mekedatu dam in Karnataka on Cauvery, claiming that it will affect farmers in their state. While the House was adjourned twice during the Zero Hour, it was again adjourned till 2 PM during the Question Hour, despite assurances by the government that Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari would make a statement on the issue.  The House was first adjourned for 15 minutes at around 11.25 am and again till noon. When it met again during question hour, it was adjourned within minutes till 2 pm. As AIADMK members, who were joined by those of the DMK during Question Hour, shouted slogans of ""We want justice"", the Congress members were on their feet raising the slogan ""We want JPC"". The protests started soon after Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu made a fervent appeal for smooth functioning of the House as only four working days were left in the current Winter session and many important bills and discussions were pending. The Rajya Sabha has faced repeated disruptions on various issue and not transacted any substantial business since it met on December 11 for the Winter session. ""People are ridiculing us,"" Naidu said, referring to repeated adjournments in the Upper House because of disruptions. Naidu expressed anguish that the image of the House was ""taking a beating"" and warned that action could be taken against members protesting in the Well. He ""earnestly"" requested members to co-operate in clearing the bills and taking up discussions on issues like Rafale deal, agrarian crisis, price rise and cyclones in some states. Naidu said action would be taken against members protesting in the Well, if there is consensus in the House. However, he added that action would be against all members who troop into the Well. ""It cannot be selective"". During the Question Hour, Deputy Chairman Harivansh said Lok Sabha is functioning, but Rajya Sabha is unable to do any business. ""The Chairman is very concerned with your issue and that is why he has called the minister concerned to talk to you. Please allow him to talk to you. He is at a function and left it and is coming here. He will talk to you soon,"" he said. ""You are not allowing the House to function. The entire country is watching that the House has not functioned since last 11th. The minister is coming, please wait,"" the deputy chairman again said while making an appeal to the protesting members to allow the House to function.  Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel also said, ""I request the AIADMK members that after talks with them, we have already asked Minister Nitin Gadkari to talk to you and make a statement in the House. Please allow the House to function."" However, the unrelenting AIADMK members first raised slogans from their seats and then entered the Well. They also displayed placards on Cauvery issue. They were later joined by DMK members in the Well and amid the din the house was adjourned till 2 pm by the Deputy Chairman.","Jan 02, 2019, 01:35 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rs-proceedings-disrupted-due-to-protests-by-aiadmk-dmk/articleshow/67347130.cms
"Protests in Kerala as 2 women enter Sabarimala temple, state-wide shutdown tomorrow",Protests erupted in various parts of Kerala Wednesday against the entry of two women in their forties into the Lord Ayyappa temple.,"An umbrella organisation of various pro-Hindutva groups have called for a state-wide shutdown Thursday, amid protests at several places after entry of two women into the Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala.As the news of the women entering the temple spread, protests erupted with right-wing activists blocking highways and forcing closure of shops and markets. Media personnel, reporting from outside the state secretariat, were allegedly attacked by BJP and Yuva Morcha activists.Announcing the dawn-to-dusk shutdown on behalf of the Sabarimala Karma Samiti Samiti, its leader K P Sasikala said the government has betrayed devotees.The Samiti, which is spearheading protests against the Supreme Court's September 28 verdict allowing women of all age groups to offer prayers at the hill shrine, urged people to cooperate with them in their protest. Sasikala said the protests would continue till Pinarayi Vijayan resigns as chief minister.Scripting history, two women who are in their 40s entered the Ayyappa temple early Wednesday and offered prayers.Sasikala said the government acted like a ""coward"" and took the women to the shrine during the early hours.Among the journalists attacked were Asianet reporter Prakula, Deccan Chronicle photojournalist Peethambaran Payyeri, Mathrubhumi video-journalist Biju. Camera and equipment of channels like Mathrubhumi and Media One were also damaged.The Kerala Union of Working Journalists' flayed the attack on the media personnel and sought stern action.This is the the seventh shutdown called by right-wing groups in just three months over the Sabarimala issue.Traders' organisations have said they will not cooperate with the shutdown and sought police protection to open their establishments.On December 20, over 35 trade organisations in Kerala had come together to announce that 2019 will be 'anti-hartal year'.The Antharashtriya Hindu Parishad has also called for a hartal Thursday.The Nair Service Society, an outfit of Kerala's forward Nair community, condemned the violation of Sabarimala's centuries-old tradition and said it would continue its legal battle to protect the faith of Ayyappa devotees.NSS, which has filed a review plea in the Supreme Court challenging its verdict, expressed hope that the top court would take a favourable decision. The top court will consider the review plea on January 22.Addressing a meeting of NSS members on the occasion of the Mannam Jayanti celebrations at its headquarters in Changanassery near Kottayam, NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair said it would approach the Centre if the apex court rejects its plea. ""We will continue our legal battle,"" he said.""If there is a divine intervention, definitely, the verdict will be in favour of us,"" Nair added.An ordinance is the only other way out if the top court rejects the plea seeking review of its earlier verdict, he said.The Supreme Court had refused to stay its verdict allowing entry of women of all age groups into the shrine, but agreed to hear in open court on January 22 a batch of review petitions in the matter.Nair supported the decision taken by the chief priest of the temple to perform a 'purification' ceremony after the two women entered the shrine and offered prayers, violating the tradition of the temple.Raising voice against the shutdown, tourism industry representatives, including Kerala Tourism Task Force convener Abraham George, said the sector was gradually returning to normal after last August's deluge.In view of the severe damage to the sector in the floods causing huge revenue loss, the tourism industry will function as usual during the shutdown, a statement issued by the representatives said.They urged the government, political parties, other organisations and public to cooperate for the smooth functioning of the tourism sector.","Jan 02, 2019, 06:51 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/protests-in-kerala-after-two-women-enter-sabarimala-temple/articleshow/67347043.cms
GST Council to meet on Jan 10; to consider 5% GST on under-construction flats,"Currently, businesses with a turnover of up to Rs 20 lakh are exempted from GST. The Council could consider hiking the threshold to Rs 75 lakh for only MSMEs.","The GST Council is slated to meet on January 10 to discuss lowering GST on under-construction flats and houses to 5 per cent, as well as hiking exemption threshold for small and medium enterprises.The council, in its previous meeting on December 22, 2018, had rationalised the 28 per cent tax slab and reduced rates on 23 goods and services.""The next meeting is scheduled for January 10,"" an official told media.This would be the 32nd meeting of the council, which is chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprises his state counterparts.Briefing reporters after the recent council meeting, Jaitley had said that the next meeting would consider rationalisation of tax rates on residential properties and raising the threshold limit for MSMEs from the current Rs 20 lakh.Also, the council would consider a composition scheme for small suppliers, apart from discussing levying a calamity cess as well as GST rates on the lottery.The GST Council is likely to consider lowering GST on under-construction flats and houses to 5 per cent, an official said.Currently, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied at 12 per cent on payments made for under-construction property or ready-to-move-in flats where completion certificate has not been issued at the time of sale.However, GST is not levied on buyers of real estate properties for which completion certificate has been issued at the time of sale.An official said that this 12 per cent GST rate ideally would have been partially offset by way of taxes paid on inputs by builders and hence the actual incidence of GST on under-construction home buyers would have been around 5-6 per cent. However, builders are not passing on the input tax credit (ITC) benefit to consumers.""One of the proposals before the council is to lower the GST rate to 5 per cent for builders who purchase 80 per cent of inputs from registered dealers,"" an official said.Also the report of group of ministers looking into the concerns of MSMEs under the GST regime would be taken up for consideration.Currently, businesses with a turnover of up to Rs 20 lakh are exempted from GST. The Council could consider hiking the threshold to Rs 75 lakh for only MSMEs.Besides, the council would consider composition scheme for small suppliers, since it felt that the number of small service providers getting registered under GST was not on expected lines.""An in-principle unanimous decision was taken that a composition scheme be framed for small service providers. The threshold and composition charge would be decided in the next meeting,"" Jaitley had said on December 22.With regard to GST on the lottery, currently, state-organised lottery attract 12 per cent GST, while state-authorised lottery attracts 28 per cent.A final view would be taken as to whether the status quo should continue on GST on the lottery or if there is a scope to tweak it.Also, a view on levying calamity cess under GST would be discussed by the council.Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi led-group of ministers (GoM) had in October had decided to seek states' views on whether a state-specific or a nationwide 'disaster tax' should be levied under the GST.The GST Council, the highest decision-making body of the new tax regime, had in September decided to set up a seven-member GoM to consider a cess for Kerala flood rehabilitation.""The next GST Council meeting within 3 weeks of the last meeting clearly shows the proactive approach of the government towards concerns of the industry and to resolve them at the earliest,"" EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said.","Jan 02, 2019, 01:34 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/gst-council-to-meet-on-jan-10-to-consider-5-gst-on-under-construction-flats/articleshow/67346921.cms
Agusta case: Attempts being made to corner Sonia and Rahul Gandhi before  Lok Sabha polls,"The Sena, an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra, further alleged that the government machinery was being misused to nail political opponents.","The Shiv Sena Wednesday charged that the claims of alleged middleman Christian Michel in AgustaWestland case were an attempt to corner Congress leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.The Sena, an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra, further alleged that the government machinery was being misused to nail political opponents.A Delhi court hearing the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case had last week imposed restrictions on Michel meeting his lawyers in the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) custody.This was after the agency said he was misusing legal access by passing chits to the advocates asking them how to tackle questions on ""Mrs Gandhi"".In its application seeking extension of Michel's remand, the ED, which is the probe agency in the case, also claimed that he had spoken during questioning about the ""son of an Italian lady"" and how he is going to become the next prime minister of the country.The Sena said when Michel was extradited from Dubai, Assembly poll campaigns were in progress in five states and the ""BJP's tail was on fire"".""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had at some poll rallies spoken about this middleman and claimed there would be explosive revelations and that he would not spare anybody. We now understand what he was hinting at,"" the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana'.It is ""laughable"" that even before the probe against Michel could begin, Modi pointed fingers at the Gandhi family and cleared the line of probe, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.""The BJP, which was supposed to lose polls in five states, lost despite Michel's extradition to India. It can be clearly gauged that 'Mission Michel' is aimed at 2019,"" the Marathi publication said.Referring to the verdict in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh encounter case, it said BJP chief Amit Shah and others got a clean chit in it as the CBI ""pleaded before the court that there was pressure on the agency to name big BJP leaders"".Their names would have stayed in the list of the accused had the Congress been in power and the Congress today is making similar allegations, it said.""The government machinery is under the feet of two- four people and being used wrongly to nail political opponents,""the Sena alleged.It said there have been allegations of kickbacks received in the AgustaWestland deal and the culprits, no matter how ""big"" they are, should not be spared.But, just because Michel has taken the name of Sonia Gandhi and other Congress leaders, people will not forget the Rafale jet scam, it said.""Like Sonia Gandhi and others have been named here (in AgustaWestland case), the former French president has named Anil Ambani (group) and this (Rafale) scam is worth some thousands of crores,"" the Sena said.""This is an attempt to corner Sonia Gandhi and his son before 2019 (polls) and after Quattrocchi (late Italian businessman who was a key figure in the Bofors scandal), Michel 'puran' will begin in the country now,"" it said.Issues like inflation, unemployment, demonetisation, farmer suicides and Ram temple will take the back seat now and elections will be fought on Michel's name, the editorial said in sarcastic remarks.","Jan 02, 2019, 02:08 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/agusta-case-attempts-being-made-to-corner-sonia-and-rahul-gandhi-before-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/67347145.cms
IndiGo flight made priority landing in Ahmedabad due to an unusual smell,IndiGo said that the airline made a priority landing at Ahmedabad. ,"NEW DELHI: An IndiGo flight flying between Delhi and Ahmedabad made a priority landing at Ahmedabad airport after the crew noticed an unusual smell inside the aircraft.

"Outlook 2019: Residential realty will not make you money; commercial will, or wait for REITs",,"There has never been a better moment to buy your dream house – investment or otherwise.There is a big but though. The elephant in the room is residential real estate, which is telling you not to uncork the bubbly so soon or be so lavish with house-warming party.So, what's cooking?Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Industrial Investment Trust Ltd  moved down by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »The residential segment is still a big mess, as demand crawls and supply is in abundance. The sector is grappling with various issues, namely liquidity deficit in the aftermath of IL&FS payment default, high cost of capital, below-par sales and a string of stalled projects.""The residential segment is facing serious headwinds at the moment. Though sales have started picking up, it will take some time for serious price appreciation to start happening,” said Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants. End users are obviously rejoicing, as prices have hit rock bottom and developers are bending over backwards to court genuine buyers. Sandeep Raina, Associate Director, Edelweiss Investment Research, said: ""A full-fledged recovery in the residential space is at least 12-18 months away, given the recent liquidity crisis and slower-than-expected sales recovery. Launches have dropped drastically with many under-construction projects getting stalled due to funding issues.""But it's not all gloom & doom. You can still have your share of indulgence as commercial real estate promises exciting returns, going forward.""In the current market, commercial real estate – especially Grade A office properties - is definitely the best-performing real estate asset class. Thanks to the incumbent government’s proactive initiatives such as Make in India and the thriving start-up culture in the country, demand and absorption for well-located office properties has been exceptionally high with rental yield going as high as 10 per cent in certain markets,"" Puri told ETMarkets.com.And steep pricing should be no dampener there. ""Investors who find ticket sizes of such properties too steep can await the imminent announcement of India’s first REIT (real estate investment trust) listings. These will operate like mutual funds for real estate and allow investors with budgets as low as Rs 2 lakh to invest in this thriving segment of real estate,"" he said. Will 2019 turn out to be any bit smooth, then? Raina says demand in office and retail sectors will continue to beat supplies, leading to lower vacancies and higher rental yields in 2019-20. Also, private equity participation is quite high in commercial assets, which lends more shine to this space.Affordable and mid-income segments are likely to get top billing, with better sales in 2019 against the luxury category, as the government doubles down on its housing for all promise.Puri thinks consolidation is the way forward and the industry can't avoid it. He sees a clear trend towards affordable housing by leading developers, but new project launches could fall off the curve.When it comes to liquidity, he doesn't expect any significant improvement until at least first half of 2019. ""While housing prices will remain flat, private equity players will continue to make select investment forays. Ready-to-move-in housing will take the centrestage, as do alternate asset classes such as student housing, senior living, warehousing and retail in tier II and III cities,"" Puri said.The liquidity crisis that roiled NBFCs (non-banking finance companies) and HFCs (housing finance companies) almost broke the back of the sector, as accessing capital from lenders got a lot tougher. Raina is hopes for a quicker resolution can put things back on track.""Recent liquidity crisis led to funding issue for local developers and a few big developers, due to which many ongoing projects have got stalled. A quicker resolution of the liquidity crisis is important. There’s a large mismatch between supply and actual demand in terms of unit and ticket size. Focus on right sizing and right pricing is the need of the hour to meet the large unmet demand of end users,” Raina said.Stamp duty comes up as another layer of price to already existing high-priced units. Raina makes a pitch to rationalise stamp duty, which in turn can drive volumes to offset lost revenue for states.The road is still not all clear. Industry players find high GST as a thorn in the crown. ""High GST rates have deterred several homebuyers from buying under-construction properties in 2018, their preference is largely tilting towards ready properties only, which is exempt. The government is discussing reducing the 12 per cent GST rate on housing to boost demand in 2019. If a lower GST is approved, it will be a major boost for the residential segment,"" Anarock chairman said.From a policy perspective, the government may have shown a clear intent to remove bottlenecks, with a clutch of reforms such as GST and IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code). RERA (Real Estate Regulation Authority) is also a case in point, but its implementation leaves a lot to be desired and remains patchy so far.""Even after one-and-a-half years since its implementation, it falls way too short of the mark. As it stands now, there are quite a few states still in the process of notifying RERA rules, while there are others where buyers have been continuously complaining about dilution of the notified rules,"" Puri pointed out.Elevated cost of capital to finance projects is another pain the neck for builders and developers. In absence of bank finance, developers are turning to PE (private equity) funding and other non-formal ways to bankroll land purchases, ultimately pushing up cost of capital drastically.With pan-India property sales looking a pale shadow of its former self, Bengaluru is a whiff of fresh air. In the commercial space, the Garden City tops the pack that is likely to see an uptick in 2019 from both demand and supply points of view, with NCR and Hyderabad following closely. Going by Anarock data, Bengaluru saw the maximum absorption at nearly 12 million square feet in 2018, an annual jump of 37 per cent. The trend is likely to continue if the macroeconomic indicators stay favourable.""For the past several quarters, sales have exceeded launches in the top seven cities and unsold inventory has come down to nearly 5,00,000 units as of H1 of 2018. Unsold inventory remains the highest in the NCR region, followed by MMR region and Bengaluru,"" Edelweiss' Raina said.""Bengaluru and Hyderabad markets are expected to continue to do well with consistent sales momentum,"" he said.So, it's advantage commercial realty. If you happen to be a real estate investor, you might ask, what's in it for me?Puri's prescription is, if you’re focused on residential real estate – which most investors are because of lower ticket sizes compared with commercial properties - keep your expectations limited and maintain a long-term horizon of at least 5 years. The residential segment will take time to pick up. Office and retail sectors are making all the buzz. ""For an investor with a minimum 3-5 years of horizon, one can look at a few micro markets for residential real estate investment, as the shift takes place from unorganised to organised segments. Office and retail sectors can be considered good investment options for yields to the tune of 10-13 per cent,"" Raina said.Khushru Jijina, MD, Piramal Capital and Housing Finance, has the last word. ""Calendar 2018 was a moderate year for the real estate sector with various external shocks like demonetisation, RERA and GST affecting buyer's confidence across markets even though the longer-term impact of these regulatory measures was seen to be largely positive,"" he said. Against this backdrop, 2019 kicks off on a subdued note in the run-up to general elections, due sometime mid next year. Keep your powder dry.  Others Look, what 2019 may hold for you!

"Lok Sabha adjourns till 2 pm amid protests by AIADMK, TDP","Immediately after the House reconvened at noon, AIADMK and TDP members trooped into the Well with placards and started shouting slogans. ","The government on Wednesday introduced the Aadhaar and other laws amendment bill in Lok Sabha which adjourned soon after till 2 pm amid continuing protests by members of the AIADMK and the TDP over various issues. Immediately after the House reconvened at noon, AIADMK and TDP members trooped into the Well with placards and started shouting slogans. The AIADMK was protesting construction of a dam across the Cauvery river, while the TDP was demanding special financial assistance for Amravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh. Despite the request from Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, the members continued their protest and some of them flung torn pieces of papers towards the table where Lok Sabha secretariat officials sit during proceedings. A visibly peeved Mahajan sought names of the unruly members. As per rules, if the Speaker names a member over objectionable conduct, than the member has to leave the House immediately. ""Please go to your seat,"" Mahajan told the protesting members. Amid the ruckus, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad introduced the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2018. The amendment would provide legal backing for seeding of biometric ID Aadhaar with mobile numbers and bank accounts as an optional KYC (know your customer) after the Supreme Court barred mandatory use of the 12-digit unique identification number by private firms. Earlier, Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned till noon following protests by members from the AIADMK and the TDP. Soon after the House convened for the day, members from the AIADMK trooped into the Well. Later, members from the TDP also joined them. Around 30 members from both the parties were in the Well. As soon as the AIADMK members started their protest, Mahajan said that their problem would not be solved like this and asked them to discuss the issue with the minister concerned. ""I don't think it sends the right message to your state... this unruly behaviour must stop,"" she told the protesting members. A question related to vacancies in lower judiciary was taken up during the Question Hour, which went on for around 20 minutes.

View: A bad loan farce gets another rerun in India,RBI's new move to allow banks to restructure small-ticket loans is a big bad news for India.,"by Andy MukherjeeA new year, a new central bank governor. Yet the first salvo to come out of the Reserve Bank of India’s policy arsenal in 2019 is encouragement of good old “extend and pretend” lending.Banks and shadow banks are being allowed a one-time restructuring of loans of up to 250 million rupees ($3.6 million) to micro, small and medium enterprises that were in default on Jan. 1, without having to mark them as nonperforming, the RBI said on Tuesday. Lenders are being given an extension of 15 months (up to March 31, 2020) to pretend that these stressed loans are standard. All they have to do is to make additional 5 percent loss provisions. By contrast, a secured loan classified as nonperforming attracts immediate provisioning of 15 percent, rising progressively to 40 percent – even 100 percent – as recovery became increasingly doubtful.What’s disturbing here is the U-turn in the RBI’s philosophy. Classifying restructured loans as nonperforming is a standard prudential requirement. India relaxed the norm in 2001 to encourage banks to clean up an overhang of corporate debt that had piled up in the exuberant first decade of the country’s economic liberalization. The solution back then lay in encouraging lenders to send problem loans to so-called Corporate Debt Restructuring, or CDR, an out-of-of-court mechanism that helped banks recover some money in the absence of a modern bankruptcy law. Lenders could keep loans referred to the CDR as standard on the books, meaning they didn’t have to make steep provisions for losses. Bloomberg However, the temporary palliative became a perennial crutch. When dealing with the aftermath of a different credit cycle in May 2013, it became clear to the RBI that banks were using the restructuring fig leaf to hide bad loans. To end the abuse, the RBI said it would scrap the asset-classification forbearance by April 1, 2015.Even before that day arrived, there was enormous lobbying by banks at the behest of powerful corporate borrowers. India then was ranked 136th in the world for resolving insolvency; a modern bankruptcy law was still more than a year away. So RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan relented and gave lenders new tools – Strategic Debt Restructuring, or SDR, and (a year later) Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets, or S4A – to avoid making provisions.It wasn’t a free lunch. Rajan also began an asset-quality review in 2015, forcing banks to step up disclosure of bad debt. The stick annoyed errant debtors more than the restructuring carrot pleased them. Rajan had to leave after just a single three-year term. But his successor Urjit Patel continued to tighten the screws. Now that there finally was a functioning bankruptcy law, Patel scrapped all the halfway houses – CDR, SDR and S4A – in February last year. Relaxed norms for asset classification and loan-loss provisioning also went away. Bloomberg That shock therapy made corporate lobbyists more livid. Facing an all-round assault on the central bank’s capacity for independent action, Patel abruptly left last month before completing his tenure. The new RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has begun his term by bringing back forbearance in a small but significant way. It’s small because India’s 101 trillion rupee credit market is overwhelmingly skewed toward large borrowers. Non-farm business loans of less than 250 million rupees account for only 22 percent of the pie; remove individual borrowers, and the share shrinks to 13 percent.Yet it’s a significant step politically. Small business loans have been under elevated stress since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s disastrous November 2016 move to outlaw 86 percent of the country’s cash, a policy blunder followed up by a goods and services tax that raised compliance costs for a large number of tiny firms. The nonperforming asset ratio for the larger of the MSME borrowers – ticket size between 100 million and 250 million rupees – was 14.5 percent in June, up from 12.8 percent two years ago.The banks don't want this pile to grow any further. That much is obvious. It’s also clear that the Modi government wants to ease the tax compliance burden on small businesses ahead of general elections that will be held by May. However, it’s not the job of the banking regulator to join the government as a sentiment booster.N.S. Vishwanathan, an RBI deputy governor, said last April that “shorn of all forbearances” India’s new regulatory framework for stressed assets was finally on par with international norms, and that giving up on it would amount to “letting go waste” India’s landmark bankruptcy regulation.That’s the risk now. Small business owners – as well as distressed farmers – have clout only before elections; billionaires wield their power indefinitely. Getting politicians to promise farm-debt waivers and 59-minute SME loans is easy. But now that the RBI has started flip-flopping, it’ll become that much easier for the tycoons to rewind the credit culture – back to the debtor-friendly show it always was.

"Outlook 2019: Stocks down sharply, but consumer durables holds durable promise",,"By G ChokkalingamNearly 20 consumer durables stocks are listed on the domestic stock market. And almost all of them have fallen anywhere between 5 per cent and as high as 65 per cent from their 52-week highs in 2018. Most of them are smallcap or midcap stocks and their poor performance was in line with the crash in smallcap and midcap (SMC) segments.Since their January 2018 peaks, stocks of the small and midcap segments have lost collectively close to Rs 20 lakh crore in market-caps.The consumer durables sector basically hold a solid outlook for the long term. Rapid urbanisation and ever-growing per capita income in the economy can ensure this industry’s unlimited growth potential. Rising temperature, pollution levels, evolving consumer lifestyles also favour the consumer durables industry.Recent changes in taxation on consumer durables are also throwing up some opportunities to this industry. In July, many durables such as hair dryers to shavers, mixer grinders, vaccum cleaners, refrigerators, washing machines and small televisions were shifted from 28 per cent to 18 per cent GST tax brackets.Meanwhile, customs duty was doubled for a category of white goods, including air-conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators in September 2018. This would improve the competitive edge for domestic producers. On December 22, GST rate on TV sets with screen sizes of up to 32 inches was lowered to 18 per cent from 28 per cent earlier. Now only air conditioners including five-star inverter ACs are left in the highest 28 per cent tax slab.Substantial tax reduction for most of the consumer durables items would help the industry improve growth in revenues as the tax benefits are expected to be passed on to the end users.However, in the short term, the industry is likely to face some weakness. Having lent large sums as consumer durables loans over the past couple of years, banks seem to be shying away from them, possibly fearing delinquencies. Outstanding loans to the segment dropped sharply by 82 per cent year-on-year to Rs 3,225 crore on September 28. OthersMovement of BSE Consumer Durables index vs BSE Sensex Moreover, both kharif and rabi crop outputs have fallen marginally this year. A fall in overall agricultural output is likely to compensate the benefits expected for the farmers from the proposed increase in support prices for agricultural crops. Worldwide also, food crop prices are on a downswing. Hence, this industry is likely to face weakness in sales in the rural markets in the short term.The threats to the industry are not substantial. A rise in import duty on some consumer durables items and over 12 per cent depreciation in the rupee exchange rate provide some protection to the domestic consumer durables manufacturers. The forthcoming general elections will also augur well for the industry – as anticipated loan waivers for farmers in many states could improve their appetite to buy consumer durables. A substantial correction in the stock prices provides good opportunity to buy select consumer durables stocks in the New Year for long-term wealth creation.

"In 2019, invest  in 10 equal instalments and then wait: Nimesh Shah, ICICI Pru AMC","
“2019 is going to be tremendously interesting for fund managers as it is a stock pickers’ market.”","The banking sector is an obvious recovery that all of us are playing for and some very good bets are available,           Nimesh Shah, MD & CEO, ICICI Prudential AMC, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: When we met exactly a year ago, you said beware of mid and smallcap stocks. Valuations were hogwash. The script has panned out the way you predicted in small and midcap stocks. What has been you big reflexion point for 2018? We were pretty sure because of the numbers involved. We went wrong in 2017 in midcaps. Right from 2017 we have been saying that midcaps are too overvalued. 2018 was the peak and we decided to exit. I am very satisfied when I reflect on 2018. The best thing that we did in January 2018 was we returned smallcap, midcap money and those investors are super happy. They went out with 41-42% IRR and that created a very happy set of customers. So, that was very satisfying. In 2018, we had always believed that we need to be very cautious in our stance and that is where all our funds had a relatively cautious stance especially till the time when oil was very high.  As oil has been coming down, our view has been changing. In 2018, we entered everything. The PEs were too high, the midcap and small cap PEs were at ridiculous level. Now it is a very interesting time for markets. We are entering 2019 when the markets are neither very expensive nor very cheap. The trailing PE or even the forward PE is at average level. This is where a fund manager’s skill sets are involved. In 2013, it was very easy to come and give a crying buy call because those midcaps were available at 4 PE.  It was very easy to come on your channel and say that buy and launch fund every month practically to collect the midcap money. That is what we did in 2013. It was different. Midcaps were at 4 PE. Today even after the correction, midcaps are still not that cheap. I am not worried as I was worried one year back but it is not in the cheap zone. Nothing is in the cheap zone.  As fund managers, 2019 is going to be tremendously interesting for us because it is a stock pickers’ market. Which stocks and which sectors to bet on now is going to be very important because in a 2013 kind of market, it was very easy to pick stocks because whatever you picked up, even if you were inefficient, went up.  In 2017, it was very difficult because you only had to pick up what will fall less. Now, it is a very interesting time. Whatever is happening to macro situations, how we convert that into our stock picking is what is going to define us. Crude has got crushed. Interest rates are unlikely to move higher. Rupee has stabilised. Foreign selling has reduced and domestic institutional investors are supporting the market. From a positioning standpoint, you had argued this is a picture perfect scenario. What happens when the picture takes an ugly turn? We know what are the sources of volatility. 100 people would have come on your channel and said that 2019 is going to be a volatile year. So, there is one common agreement. Because of the various macro features whether it is Indian politics or US markets or US-China trade or whatever, we are going to see a lot of volatility. When the 90 days are over, again we will see some news headlines and all. So,will there be continuous news flows? There is going to be continuous news flow. Will there be volatility? We believe in volatility. And is the market fairly valued? Market is fairly valued.  But what is the positive? We believe that corporate earnings are coming back. We are seeing those signs and we are seeing various sectors where we believe corporate earnings are coming. So in 2019, I cannot thump the table and say invest all your money today! I cannot say that. But 2019 is a very simple call. Whatever you want to invest, invest in 10 different parts and finish your investment by October.  I do not know what is the political reality that is going to come up in May. But I do not think it matters because we are working for corporate profitability to come back, profitability which has now grown well in the last five years, will grow well in the next three years. That is our call and we are talking corporate by corporate even without the banking sector. The banking sector is an obvious recovery that all of us are playing for and some very good bets are available. With the NBFC crisis also, a lot of opportunities have come to the banks. Now going could not have been better for the banks right now. Looking at those opportunities that I see in 2000 in the three-year corporate turnaround that I expect to happen, I would say invest in 2019 in 10 equal instalments and then wait. I have never heard you that bullish on banks for the longest time I have interacted with you. Is this secretly the banker speaking or a fund manager’s view? Eleven-twelve years I am in this job. It means whichever bank has liability is now king. Those banks that have managed to create liabilities have done well over the last many years. These banks have worked very hard to create a retail liability franchise and I have got a brand with them. People want money.  NBFCs would not be able to reach them because NBFCs will have to consolidate. They have grown very fast over the last three-four years. They have to get their liabilities side right. So who is going to benefit out of that? People will need money and banks which are positioned well whether it is in corporate banking or retail banking.  If the corporate banks do not capitalise at this time, they can never capitalise it. I believe nothing can. Within next two or three quarters, you will see the write-offs going up as high as 60-70%. I do not think new NPAs are happening.

Bengal Congress in a dilemma over whether to go alone or with CPI(M),"Once a formidable force in West Bengal, the CPI(M)-led Left Front has yielded much ground to the Trinamool Congress, but still has organisational presence across the state.","Majority of the state Congress leaders are in favour of an informal seat sharing arrangement with the CPI(M) in West Bengal for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, senior party leaders said.A Congress leader said a section of leaders still want to go alone.Party sources said a final call on the issue would be taken by AICC president Rahul Gandhi.Once a formidable force in West Bengal, the CPI(M)-led Left Front has yielded much ground to the Trinamool Congress, but still has organisational presence across the state.Senior Congress leader and chairman of the coordination committee, Pradip Bhattachrya, told PTI that there is a section which is in favour of seat adjustment with the CPI(M) and this section is in the majority.There is also a section which wants to go alone, he said.A senior Congress leader privy to the developments told PTI that a meeting would be called of state party leaders this month to decide on the strategy and inform its opinion to the party high command.""The mood of majority of party leaders is in favour of a seat adjustment with the CPI(M), although there is a minority opinion about going alone. We will call a meeting of the ,"" the party leader said.Gandhi gave a 'mantra' for strengthening the organisation during a meeting with PCC chief Somen Mitra and party in-charge of state Gaurav Gogoi last month.Some of the top state Congress leaders have already begun ""informal talks"" with some CPI(M) leaders over the issue of seat adjustment.The Congress is mulling fighting at least 18-20 seats out of the 42 seats in the state. It presently has only four seats.Another state Congress leader said Gandhi had asked them to strengthen the organisation.""He has left the decision to the state unit and will take a final call, after the Bengal unit takes a decision on it. But we are yet to convey our decision on whether we want to fight the Lok Sabha elections alone or in an alliance with the Left in the state,"" the leader said.CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, during a recent visit to Kolkata, had said his party would try and consolidate the anti-BJP and anti-Trinamool votes in West Bengal in the coming general elections.""Our party's three-point call is clear. Defeat the BJP and its allies, increase the strength of the CPI(M) and other Left forces in Parliament and form an alternative secular government at the Centre in 2019. There is still time, let us see,"" Yechury had said.Both the state Congress and CPI(M) leadership are hopeful that a ""possible solution"" will come up when Yechury meets Gandhi this month.Presently, the TMC has 34 MPs in the state and the Congress has four MPs. The CPI(M) and the BJP have two Lok Sabha members each.According to state Congress sources, the Bengal leadership has prepared a three-pronged strategy for the proposed seat adjustment talks with the CPI(M)-led Left Front in Bengal.Firstly, the total of six seats that was won by the Congress and the CPI(M) in 2014 have to be kept aside and secondly the primary discussion should be on the remaining 36 seats, a Congress leader said.Thirdly, the seats should be distributed according to the strength of the Congress and the CPI(M) and the latter should be able to accommodate its allies -- the Forward Bloc, the CPI and the RSP -- from its own share, the Congress leader said.""The proposition is there will not be any formal alliance. It will be a seat adjustment where the CPI(M)-led Left Front will fight in a few seats and the Congress will fight in the other seats,"" the leader said.""In the seats where the Congress is not fighting, it will appeal for maximum polling of anti-BJP, anti-TMC votes in favour of a secular candidate,"" said the Congress leader.The Bengal Congress is keen on putting up a good show in the state after the party's performance in assembly elections in three Hindi heartland states.The victory has not only galvanised the party nationally but also had a cascading effect on the morale of the party in Bengal, which for last few years have been marred by defections and infighting.The Congress sources said the party's resolve to fight against both the TMC and the BJP in the state has been strengthened due to the cold shoulder of the TMC towards the party's victory and its open declaration that it wants to contest alone in all the 42 seats.""The TMC is not willing to give due importance to the Congress or give it credit for victory in the Assembly polls. So why should we go with them? Fighting alone in Bengal means a four-cornered fight which, in turn, will help the TMC. We can never allow that,"" Congress secretary Subhankar Sarkar said.The state Congress unit is miffed with the TMC over the continuous poaching of elected representatives and alleged attack on party workers in the state.A senior CPI(M) central committee member said he was hopeful that an ""adjustment"" with the Congress can be worked out and the party would be able to take care of the ""demands"" of its allies.The CPI(M) has been able to pacify its allies, the CPI and the RSP, on the issue of seat adjustment with the Congress but the Forward Bloc is not very keen on having any pre-poll adjustment with it in West Bengal.""The main concern of the allies is, in case of seat adjustment the allies might need to part with their share of seats. If that is taken care of, then we do not think there will be any problem,"" said a senior CPI(M) leader.","Jan 02, 2019, 02:27 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/bengal-congress-in-a-dilemma-over-whether-to-go-alone-or-with-cpim/articleshow/67347761.cms
2018: SC came down heavily on real estate honchos,"SC granted one more opportunity to ArcelorMittal and Russia's VTB Bank-promoted Numetal to bid for Essar Steel, provided the two pay off the NPA's of their related corporate debtors within two weeks.","By Abhishek Anshu, Manohar Lal & Ranjit Kumar SinhaCorporate legal battle involving big business houses like ArcelorMittal and Numetal on taking over of Essar Steel and tough stand against the automobile industry on emission norms kept the Supreme Court busy in 2018 during which it also gave a body blow to real estate honchos.Be it real estate majors Unitech Ltd, Jaypee Group and Amrapali or others, all had to bear the brunt of the apex court for taking for ride ordinary citizens whose hard earned money was at stake.The year gone by saw Unitech promoters - Sanjay and Ajay Chandra failing to get relief from the top court in coming out of Tihar Jail and Amrapali boss Anil Sharma and two directors being put under police surveillance away from their homes.The Jaypee Group also had a tough time throughout the year as investors kept up the pressure for possession of their flats which have been delayed in many cases for more than five years.Amid the legal developments in the real estate sector, a big corporate battle was seen in the top court when steel and mining major ArcelorMittal approached it challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order which had held that Numetal's Rs 37,000 crore offer in second-round bid for Essar Steel was valid.The top court granted one more opportunity to ArcelorMittal and Russia's VTB Bank-promoted Numetal to bid for Essar Steel, provided the two pay off the non-performing assets of their related corporate debtors within two weeks.Another embattled corporate house, Sahara Group, was also in the news in the top court throughout the year over the issue of depositing money in the SEBI-SAHARA account for which it has been facing tough time for over six years.The ongoing litigation on air pollution took a new turn in the 2018 when the top court hit hard the automobile industry by ordering that no Bharat Stage-IV vehicle would be sold or registered in India from April 1, 2020.A tough stand was also taken by the top court to regulate the firecrackers and the industry involved in it got a rude shock before Diwali that only ""green crackers"" would be allowed to burst across the country for two hours only.The order was not limited to Diwali but for other festivals and occasions in which people burst crackers.The year gone by also saw the apex court delivering a significant verdict when it held that courts can scrutinize the rates of interest being charged by banks from farmers in states where debt relief laws are in place to deal with rural indebtedness.In a judgement having far-reaching consequences, the top court held that foreign lawyers, law firms and companies cannot practice legal profession in India.In the aviation sector, the apex court disposed of a plea filed by no-frill carrier IndiGo, challenging a Delhi High Court order to shift its operations partially from Terminal-1 (T-1) of the IGI Airport here to Terminal 2.Dealing with a matter related to pharma sector, the top court dismissed an appeal filed against the Delhi High Court verdict upholding an international arbitral award of Rs 3,500 crore passed in favour of Japanese pharma major Daiichi Sankyo.The pharma major has alleged that the former promoters of India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd had concealed information about proceedings against them by American food and drug department.","Jan 02, 2019, 02:28 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/2018-sc-came-down-heavily-on-real-estate-honchos/articleshow/67347736.cms
Government introduces Aadhaar amendment bill in Lok Sabha,Theh govt said that it has prepared a data protection bill and it will be introduced in Parliament soon.,"NEW DELHI: The government Wednesday introduced a bill in the Lok Sabha that will allow individuals to offer voluntarily biometric ID Aadhaar as a means of identity verification for obtaining services like opening a bank account and getting a mobile phone connection.The bill, which seeks to amend three separate laws governing Aadhaar, telecom sector, and banking regulation, also gives a minor an option to opt out of the 12-digit identity scheme on attaining the age of 18 years.It also provides for stiff penalties for violation of norms set for the use of Aadhaar.The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Bill 2018, moved by Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in the Lok Sabha, bans storing of core biometric information as well as Aadhaar number by service providers in cases of individuals who have voluntarily offered the national ID as a means of authentication.It also makes it clear that anyone not offering Aadhaar cannot be denied any service, be it a bank account or a SIM card.The bill seeks to amend the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002.The legislation proposes telecom service providers, apart from using Aadhaar for authentication, can also leverage offline verification, use of passport, or any other officially valid document or modes of identification as notified by the central Government.The amendments, according to the objects and reasons for the Bill, will ""provide for 12-digit Aadhaar number and its alternate numbers to be generated"" in a manner so as to conceal the actual Aadhaar number.It would also ""permit the entities performing authentication only when they are compliant with the standards of privacy and security,"" it said. The Bill also seeks to lay down the procedure for offline verification of an Aadhaar number holder, and confers enhanced regulator-like power on Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to give directions as it may consider necessary to any entity in the Aadhaar ecosystem.It says that every requesting entity to whom an authentication request is made, will inform the Aadhaar number holder of alternate and viable means of identification and shall not deny any service to them for refusing to, or being unable to undergo authentication.Mandatory authentication of an Aadhaar holder for the provision of any service will take place if such authentication is required by a law made by Parliament.The bill proposes a civil penalty of up to Rs 1 crore on entities that violate the provisions of the Aadhaar Act, with an additional fine of up to Rs 10 lakh per day in case of continuous non-compliance.Unauthorised use of identity information by a requesting entity or offline verification seeking entity would be punishable with imprisonment of up to three years with a fine that may extend to Rs 10,000 or in case of a company with a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.Punishment for unauthorised access to the Central Identities Data Repository as well as data tampering is proposed to be extended to 10 years each from the current three years. The bill also seeks to omit Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act relating to the use of Aadhaar by private entities.There will be a provision to file an appeal before the TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal), and against the orders of TDSAT an appeal can be made in the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court, in a landmark verdict in September last year, had upheld the constitutional validity of 'Aadhaar' but limited the scope of the controversial biometric identity project, ruling it is not mandatory for bank accounts, mobile connections or school admissions.Holding there was nothing in the Aadhaar Act that violates right to privacy of an individual, the SC had cleared the use of Aadhaar (world's largest biometric ID programme) for welfare schemes. The court had held that Aadhaar will remain mandatory for filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN) but struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporate to avail of the biometric Aadhaar data.Following this, the Cabinet last month approved amendments to Aadhaar Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The bill says that ""every Aadhaar number holder to establish his identity, may voluntarily use his Aadhaar number in physical or electronic form by way of authentication or offline verification or in such other form as may be notified...""It also says offline verification can be performed only with the consent of Aadhaar number holder.","Jan 02, 2019, 11:30 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/government-introduces-aadhaar-amendment-bill-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/67349185.cms

Outlook 2019: FMCG innovates to cash in on shift in consumer preferences,Premium detergents in urban markets will continue to grow at 15-20 per cent per annum.,"By Sagarika Mukherjee India’s FMCG story looks interestingly poised as we step into a new Calendar. From bigger awareness levels to better product quality, attractive offers and consumer shift to naturals; it looks like we have a good tailwind for volume and profit growth, though some challenges remain.So, what to expect from this sector in 2019?Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd  moved up by 2 in a month on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »1) We expect the naturals segment within well penetrated categories to continue growing, led by a strong shift in consumer preferences to buy products which are herbal, natural, organic and to shun products with chemical substances.2) Naturals as a segment is already 25 per cent of toothpaste category, and brands that have ‘naturals’ positioning like Dabur Red, Swarnavedshakti, Dant Kanti will continue to grow in double digits (10-15% YoY).3) In personal care products (shampoos, fairness creams, conditioners, hair oils), the consumer in urban markets is definitely moving towards “higher value” products, as most companies have launched variants of their flagship products at higher prices, citing additional benefits (especially hair fall control, hair repair, volume, hydration) by including ingredients like argan oil, turmeric, aloe vera and keratin.4) Categories that can see tailwind in skincare are pure extractions of rose oil, argan oil/Moroccon oil and virgin coconut oil, which consumers are using now instead of creams. However, since these pure oil extracts are expensive (Rs 650 -1,000 for 25-100ml bottles) and getting added as an additional product in skin care/ hair care regime, we don’t see any volume pressure for fairness cream brands.5) In hair oils, the category has got divided into two sub-segments of ‘low cost’ hair oils and ‘ayurvedic’. Hair oils with anti-hair fall benefits are growing the fastest. The low-cost segment, which has coconut and amla hair oil brands like Parachute, Anmol, VVD Gold, Dabur Amla, Nihar Shanti Amla, Parachute Jasmine and Dabur Jasmine is growing at 6-15 per cent per annum. While ayurvedic hair oils with ‘anti-hair fall’ attributes are benefitting from the whole naturals wave and are getting stocked by all channels – modern retail, e-com, GT, chemists alike and brands like Indulekha (Rs 432/100ml) are even strong in wholesale channels, highlighting that it is also fast moving.What’s pushing larger SKUsPremium detergents in urban markets will continue to grow at 15-20 per cent per annum, led by 360-degree push by the top players like HUL, P&G, Jyothy Labs for Surf Excel/ Surf Excel Easy Wash, Ariel, Ariel Matic, Tide Plus, Tide Naturals, Henko Lintelligent. Companies are ploughing back the commodity benefits, tax rate cuts, input tax credit on wider basket of goods and services and spending on both ad-spends and promotional offers to sell larger SKUs (stock keeping units).In modern trade and e-com, it has now become a norm almost to sell 4kg / 6kg SKUs in detergents and 375/650ml SKUs in shampoos. With more awareness, consumers are shunning local brands and premium players are offering additional benefits, upgrading technology to improve product quality and offering price offs to an extent where the consumer is tempted to shift towards these ‘premium’ brands. This is not affecting margins of these companies, as selling more volumes only gives them scale benefits and bargain power. A similar trend is visible in shampoos, hand wash and shower gels. OthersBSE FMCG index vs BSE Sensex Rural markets improvingKey categories such as detergents, toilet soaps, dishwashing bars, hair oils, shampoos, fairness creams and toothpaste have all witnessed rural growth outpacing urban growth by 1.5 times (high single digit volume growth) at offtake levels and have also seen an improvement in trajectory on absolute level as they grew by 1.1 times urban growth in 2017. According to AC Nielsen, the full-year consumer offtake was 13.5 per cent in 2017 and is expected to drop to 10-11 per cent in 2018 and stabilise at those levels going forward. The reason behind the dip in growth from 2017 to 2018 was the effect of a lower base in 2016, which caused the 2017 growth figures to spike.

There exists good appetite for quality stocks and investor confidence despite turbulent market conditions,"" Lunawat said.  Markets regulator Sebi's move of bringing down the minimum anchor investor size in SME IPO to Rs 2 crore from Rs 10 crore has helped several anchor investors participate in initial share-sales of such firms.

TN moves Apex Court challenging NGT order favouring Sterlite Copper reopening,Tamil Nadu had closed the copper plant six days after 13 people were killed in police firing against protesters who wanted the factory closed on grounds that it polluted the environment.,"Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government has moved the Supreme Court challenging the recent order of National Green Tribunal setting aside a May 2018 Government Order closing Vedanta-owned Sterlite Copper and directing the state pollution control board to renew an operating licence of the 4-lakh-a-tonne factory within three weeks, according to people aware of the litigation.The case is expected to be listed for hearing soon.Tamil Nadu had closed the copper plant six days after 13 people were killed in police firing against protesters who wanted the factory closed on grounds that it polluted the environment. In its findings, the Tarun Agrawal committee set up by the NGT to investigate environmental impact said violations were not ""that grievous"" to warrant closure of the factory. Tamil Nadu government has been battling a legal war with Sterlite Copper since July last year, when the company moved the National Green Tribunal against its closure order. On May 28, Tamil Nadu government endorsed a pollution board order shuttering the factory on grounds that it was undertaking production-related activities in the absence of a renewed Consent to Operate.The state government had laid a series of hurdles in the path of Sterlite’s expansion plans such as withdrawing Consent to Establish for the second plant and so on.Sterlite Copper won a major breakthrough in the December 15 order of the NGT that set aside the closure order of Tamil Nadu. It had also applied with the state pollution control board for a new licence (Consent Toi Operate) to enable the reopening of the plant. Sterlite Copper CEO P Ramnath had announced expenditure of Rs 100 crore to improve social infrastructure in Thoothukudi. The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, on a petition filed by Anti-Sterlite protester and MDMK politician Fatima Babu, has ordered status quo on the implementation of the NGT order until January 21.","Jan 02, 2019, 03:24 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/tn-moves-apex-court-challenging-ngt-order-favouring-sterlite-copper-reopening/articleshow/67348566.cms
Banks may seek quick refuelling after Jet default,Bankers are now expected to speed up discussions with Jet to repay and raise money to resolve the cash crunch.,"Lenders to Jet Airways are expected to step up pressure on the management to recover unpaid dues and raise money through equity or sale of assets after the airline revealed that it had defaulted for the first time in December. Jet shares crashed on Wednesday and rating agency ICRA downgraded its debt to D from C, a rating usually given to companies in default or which are going to default. ""There have been delays in the implementation of the proposed liquidity initiatives by the management, which have aggravated its liquidity,"" ICRA said in a statement. ""The company has already been delaying its employee salary payments and lease rental payments to the aircraft lessors.""  The airline's share price ended at 263.75 on Wednesday, down 6.16%, after Jet informed exchanges about the default late on Tuesday night. The airline has a debt of about 8,000 crore.  ""...the payment of interest and principal instalment due to the consortium of Indian banks (led by State Bank of India) on 31st December 2018 has been delayed due to temporary cash flow mismatch and the company has engaged with them in relation to the same,"" India's second-biggest airline by market share said. Bankers are now expected to speed up discussions with Jet to repay and raise money to resolve the cash crunch.""Lenders have already been in discussion with Jet Airways regarding the stress they were facing in terms of liquidity. With this default now, that discussion will gather speed. However, the next step can only be ascertained after we know how much stress the airline is actually in... whether it's short-term stress or a sign of a larger default. That we will know only in the days to come,"" said a senior banker from a public sector bank which is a lender to the airline.  The default is the latest and most serious issue facing Jet. The loss-making, cash-strapped airline has delayed salaries, laid off staff, grounded planes and pruned flights.A person close to the development said Jet has failed to pay for the month of December which has put it in the SMA-0 category, which includes loans that are in default between 1 and 30 days. If Jet defaults beyond 30 days, it will go into SMA-1. Defaults between 61 days and 90 days is classified as SMA-2. If dues are not cleared for 90 days, it becomes a non-performing asset (NPA) for which banks have to set aside a provision in case of non-recovery. According to a circular issued by the Reserve Bank on February 12 last year, as soon as a company defaults on payments for even a day, banks have to put the account under watch and undertake steps for recovery. Jet Airways is a borrower from 26 lenders, according to its 2017-18 annual report. Bankers say with the acknowledgement of a default, the airline will be classified as SMA-0 in all bank books and lenders will have to monitor loans to Jet more closely.""Furthermore, the company has large debt repayments due over December 2018 to March 2019 (Rs 1,700 crore), FY20 (Rs 2,444.5 crore) and FY21 (Rs 2,167.9 crore). The company is undertaking various liquidity initiatives, which includes, among others, equity infusion and a stake sale in Jet Privilege Private Limited (JPPL), and the timely implementation of these initiatives remain critical to its credit profile,"" the ICRA statement added.Jet has been trying to coax strategic partner Etihad Airways to buy more stake in the carrier, but the Gulf airline won't budge unless it gets founder chairman Naresh Goyal's controlling stake. Goyal isn't willing to cede. Etihad owns 24% in Jet.Jet has asked SBI and the lending consortium for liquidity assistance or alternatively, to convert loans to equity.

Modi's benami law has companies running for cover,The case of roping a tribal to acquire land in the C'garh through sham deals opened a pandora's box for firms.,"Indian tax authorities are inundated with pleas from various trade bodies — some believed to be acting as proxies for large industry lobbies — to soften the benami law that was activated two years ago to tackle the menace of holding properties and assets in someone else’s name to escape tax, sidestep regulations and even fool creditors.The tax department has invoked the law to question a string of transactions which includes outright sham deals such as borrowing from shell companies in Kolkata to roping in a member of the tribal community as a partner in a firm to acquire land in the Chhattisgarh tribal belt.The law, claim tax practitioners, has been stretched to slap notices on corporates using opaque structures to build land banks as well as to outfits in states where locals have been used as fronts to buy properties to circumvent state laws.“There are several representations for amendments which, if enacted, would dilute the law to a great extent. The income tax Act can point out the generation of black money, but the benami Act focuses on the application of black money and is thus more effective,” a senior income tax official told ET.  However, according to lawyers and chartered accountants, the law touches upon grey areas and has put a question mark on old, accepted practices.“For instance, corporates often set up multiple vehicles to buy land. Such deals are cut quietly so that the company can negotiate without driving up the price. In one case, such vehicles of an infra company have been named ‘benamidars’, the land purchased has been described as ‘benami’ property, while the parent has been named the ‘beneficial owner’ in the notice served by the tax department. This, despite the existence of agreements between the parent company and the structures. So, the bigger question is, should companies abstain from such structures which are nontransparent but otherwise allowed under the Companies Act?” said Ashwani Taneja, former member, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai bench.For companies incorporated outside the North-East, the practice has been to hire a local as a partner for acquiring properties due to restrictions imposed by some of these states. For the taxman, some such transactions, where the land is held in the name of the local (who serves as a partner of the firm financing the acquisition), are benami in nature with the son of the soil playing the benamidar and other partners being beneficial owners.“One of the reasons for holding a property in a benami name can be the utilisation of untaxed black money. Apart from this, there can be several other reasons, like defrauding the creditors, including banks, circumventing laws, etc… The department is not questioning regular transactions under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988. The benami properties are only being provisionally attached, and that too with the approval of the relevant senior officer,” said Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of income tax (media and technical policy) and the official spokesperson for the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the apex direct tax body.With the law having a wide scope, many deals are coming back to haunt assessees. More than 400 notices, pertaining to land deals, have been served on parties in and around Jaipur for transactions aimed at circumventing the law that restricts a member of a scheduled caste from selling land to a member outside the community. “Typically, such deals were struck with the help of another SC person who acted as a front to buy the land and subsequently surrendered it with the state development authority. Once this was done, the actual beneficial owner purchased the land from the state body,” said another lawyer.According to senior chartered accountant Dilip Lakhani, while some are clear cases of benami deals, there are others where the law is invoked on the basis of a declaration by the benamidar. “Say, a chauffeur with a salary of Rs 20,000 is found to have a flat on Napean Sea Road registered in his name. Now, if he admits that the property actually belongs to his employer, there is a good reason to invoke the benami Act. But consider this: a company receives a Rs 50-crore cheque as loan from a bogus company. Earlier, this loan would have been treated as income and taxed. And if the promoter of the shell company, during the course of interrogation, says the money actually belongs to the borrower, then the law is invoked merely on the basis of a statement by a person, and not any evidence,” said Lakhani.Persons booking properties in the names of friends or relatives (not specified under the law), perhaps for personal reasons, can be pulled up by the department. “…if someone has tax-paid money, there is no reason why he/she should acquire any benami property with it,” said the CBDT official.According to her, the term ‘benami transaction’ is exhaustively defined in the amended Act to effectively check any unwarranted action or enquiry against persons entering into genuine transactions.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:08 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/companies-want-benami-blow-softened/articleshow/67358346.cms

Small renewable energy tenders likely after muted response,"The government issued two solar and wind energy tenders of 1,200 MW each on Monday as it plans to scale down the size of tenders owing to lukewarm response from industry to large capacity tenders.","The government plans to scale down size of renewable energy tenders, scrapping the idea of allotting large capacities at one go, after a recent tender for 10 GW solar capacity saw lukewarm response from the industry.Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), tasked with the implementation of the national solar mission, issued two solar and wind energy tenders of 1,200 MW each on Monday. As the government dabbles in allotting smaller capacities through each tender, tenders of 10 GW to 20 GW capacities, proposed by the power minister earlier, may not be considered anymore, government officials said.“The problem with large-scale tenders is that they tend to be undersubscribed. With smaller capacities, we expect better participation from the industry and the tariffs also tend to be more competitive,” an official told ET, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “The solar tender has been issued after a long time, and we are testing the grounds to see what happens.”Industry executives ETspoke with remained unhappy with the move. Industry watchers said small-scale tenders would stymie India’s renewable energy capacity addition.“If we have to achieve a 175 GW target, these small-scale tenders will not help. With smaller tenders, the economies of scale will not be achieved and we will always remain far behind China, which is building solar plants of 1GW each,” said an executive of a leading renewable energy firm, asking not to be named.The executive pointed out that the participation of developers in recent tenders had gone down drastically. “With over 20 companies participating in these tenders, the number has now gone to maybe four or five players.”The official cited earlier said the tenders issued by SECI would depend on market conditions, and the government would tweak the size of tenders, and tariff caps, accordingly. The 10 GW solar tender, linked with 3 GW manufacturing capacity, has also delayed the pace of tender activity in the industry, as it saw deliberations for around six months and finally was undersubscribed by a hefty 8 GW.“The industry’s interest in the tenders has gone down tremendously. We are perplexed by MNRE’s approach to capacity addition from renewables, especially the capping of tariffs,” the industry executive said.Vinay Rustagi, managing director of renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India, however, said smaller tenders should see better participation from the industry, as the individual project capacity that needed to be set up would also be small. “More importantly, in large-scale tenders, land and transmission capacity become more challenging factors comparatively,"" Rustagi added.India has set itself a target of achieving 175 GW capacity addition from renewable energy sources by 2022. In June last year, the power ministry revised this target to 227 GW.","Jan 03, 2019, 07:01 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/small-renewable-energy-tenders-likely-after-muted-response/articleshow/67358361.cms
Relief for companies facing tax outgo over valuation premiums,Experts said tax regulations had been modified in 2010 to prevent money laundering.,"Mumbai: Companies faced with a 30% tax bill over valuation premiums are set to get a reprieve after a recent government clarification asked officials not to scrutinise such transactions, said people with knowledge of the matter, adding that this could also bring some relief to startups on the angel tax front.Many firms had received tax demands after premiums were paid over the ‘fair price’ or ‘fair market value’ for fresh equity or preference shares. The demands could be withdrawn in the coming weeks, said the persons. A December 31 government notification has said that fresh issuance of shares at a premium, in most cases, should be outside the tax ambit.“The clarification would positively impact all situations where valuations were challenged by the taxman for fresh issuance of shares,” said Deloitte India partner Rajesh H Gandhi. “The revenue department will have to withdraw the tax demands as the circulars are binding on the tax department, except in cases where litigation is on and the case is pending before the courts.”ET had on December 22 and December 26 reported that the revenue department had issued notices and then raised tax demands that could run into hundreds of crores of rupees in deals where premiums were paid. Companies were asked to cough up 30% tax on the differential over and above the fair market value derived by tax department. The department had issued notices in December last year followed by demands under two income tax sections — 56(2) and 68. Both deal with taxing premiums by investors in a deal.    Section 56(2) specifically covers the issue of shares while Section 68 deals with unexplained cash credits, experts said. Gandhi said demands raised under Section 68 will not benefit from the relaxation.Experts said tax regulations had been modified in 2010 to prevent money laundering. The clarification is a recognition that such valuation premiums can be legitimate.“The intention of bringing this section in the Income Tax Act, 1961, was to prevent the transfer of shares at substantially less value done with the intention to facilitate conversion of black money,” said Amit Maheshwari, partner, Ashok Maheshwary and Associates LLP.“The intended consequence of this provision was that it could have been invoked even in case of fresh issue of shares.”Several startups could also benefit in the angel tax issue, experts said. While the clarification doesn’t specifically deal with the income tax law used to tax premiums involving startups, the logic could be extended to them.The angel tax controversy is related to valuations derived by the startups during successive rounds of funding. In several cases, revenues at startups have dropped or remained stagnant but valuations have increased.Startups have argued that this model is unique to the ecosystem. The taxman has, however, questioned the premiums paid by investors and wants to categorise them as income that would be taxable at 30%. In most cases, investments made by angel investors, venture capital funds or others have been challenged by the taxman.“Since the government has signified its intent for the provision, the same logic or clarification should also apply to section used for slapping angel tax,” said Maheshwari.Startups have continued getting tax demands under the angel tax despite government assurances.ET reported on January 1 that the latest notices issued in the last week of December specified the exact amount startups are required to pay, along with the tax calculation.Startups have continued getting tax demands under the angel tax despite government assurances","Jan 03, 2019, 10:18 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/relief-for-companie-facing-tax-outgo-over-valuation-premiums-as-govt-issues-clarification/articleshow/67358284.cms
Controversies hurt Johnson & Johnson’s sales in India,Baby talc and medical device quality issues have finally taken their toll on Johnson & Johnson.,"Mumbai: US drug maker Johnson & Johnson, stung by controversies over its baby talc and medical devices, posted its first sales decline in India since at least 2002, according to the company’s filings with the Registrar of Companies.The company posted a 3% decline in sales to Rs 5,828 crore in the year ended March 2018, while profit increased 18% amid quality issues and competition that has eaten into its market share. J&J’s growth has slowed in the past few years, compared with 10-15% expansion annually for most of the past decade.“Since J&J is not listed in India, we do not disclose market information or details that may be commercially confidential,” the company said in an email in response to ET’s queries.Revenue from J&J’s consumer business in India, including baby talc, shampoo, ear buds and sanitary pads, fell to Rs 3,092 crore in FY18.J&J, which posted worldwide sales of $76.5 billion in 2017, controls three-fourths of India’s Rs 4,000-crore baby care market, although it faces growing competition from companies including Dabur India and Himalaya Drug Company. Two years ago, Hindustan Unilever launched Dove-branded baby care products in a market where an estimated 26 million children are born every year.While the company lost share in the sanitary pads segment to Japan’s Unicharm and Procter & Gamble, J&J’s share in both soaps and skincare fell 100 basis points to 3% in 2017 from over 4.5% in 2014, as per industry estimates based on Nielsen data.India was a high-potential market for J&J with its demographic growth and the rising income level of its people. However, the slowdown for the company started in 2014, when the Maharashtra drug regulator cancelled its licence after tests showed that the baby talcum powder made at its plant was sterilised using ethylene oxide, a chemical said to cause cancer.Although J&J went to court and got its licence back, Reuters reported last year that the company deliberately hid the fact that its talc powder contained asbestos. In response to an inspection by Indian regulators, J&J said it was in full compliance with current Indian regulatory requirements for the manufacturing and testing of its talc.  “We stand behind the safety of our talc, which is routinely tested by both suppliers and independent labs to ensure it is free of asbestos,” J&J said in a statement in December 2018. The company said its baby powder is safe and asbestos-free.In 2017, J&J’s medical device business suffered when India capped the price of knee implants, reducing them by almost 70%. J&J took a $10 million (Rs 65 crore) hit on its international knee-implant business in the July-September quarter in 2017, which it blamed on the price cuts in India. The company called India’s decision to limit prices of stents and knee implants as one of the “extreme examples of what it has seen in other market places.”","Jan 03, 2019, 03:20 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/controversies-hurt-johnson-johnsons-sales-in-india/articleshow/67358420.cms
Safeguard Duty Fails to Help Local Solar Cell Manufacturers,"The safeguard duty was levied by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies, acting on a complaint by local manufacturers that imported equipment was causing their business 'serious injury'.","The 25% safeguard duty imposed on imported solar components, meant to support domestic manufacturers, has not done cell producers any good, although module makers have fared better.“We’ve got zero orders since the duty became applicable,” said the chief executive of a solar cell company, requesting anonymity. “Our factory is still shut. We are surviving with great difficulty.” Solar cell manufacturers said even with the duty, their products remained more expensive. They had suggested a safeguard duty of 70%, but following an uproar by developers, the duty was reduced to 25%.“If you require a certain price to break even, raising the competition’s cost to half of that doesn’t help,” said Dhruv Sharma, chief executive of cell manufacturing company Jupiter Solar. “We are operating at 40% capacity. If things don’t improve soon, we will definitely be heading to the National Company Law Tribunal (declaring bankruptcy).”With safeguard duty, the cost of an imported solar cell is about 12 cents. Indian manufacturers are being forced to sell at that price, too, though their input cost is 13.5 cents per cell.About 90% of panels and modules used in Indian solar projects are imported because they are cheaper.The safeguard duty was levied by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies, acting on a complaint by local manufacturers that imported equipment was causing their business “serious injury” and they were unable to compete with Chinese and Malaysian rivals on price.The imposition of the duty at the end of July sparked strong objections from project developers who claimed it would increase tariffs and impede India’s drive towards achieving its goal of 100,000 MW of solar capacity by 2022.  The safeguard duty was set for two years – in any case not more than three – and was expected to spur investment in local solar cell manufacturing, enabling achievement of scale that would help compete with global counterparts. But there have been no new investments. “When you invest in manufacturing capacity, it’s a big investment which is expected to pay off over time. A two-year declining duty is not enough to do that,” said a rooftop developer who did not want to be identified.However, domestic manufacturers of modules with imported cells have fared better after safeguard duty. Locally made modules cost 25-27 cents per piece and after the imposition of the duty, Chinese modules cost the same.“Indian module manufacturers are more competitive on price now than they were before the duty came. We source modules from China, South East Asia and India. We find there’s no clear winner on price anymore,” the rooftop developer said.About 500 MW of solar modules were manufactured in India every quarter, which rose to 650-700 MW after the duty was imposed, according to data collected by solar consultancy Bridge To India.“Because of exchange rate volatility, many small developers prefer to lock their costs upfront rather than sign their contract in dollars not knowing what they will ultimately have to pay. Hence, the smaller developers now prefer to buy Indian modules,” said Vinay Rustagi, Managing Director of Bridge To India.Module manufacturers are still not fully satisfied. “We are optimising our investments, making our modules more competitive, improving the product portfolio, but we are not planning any large investments till the government gets serious about improving the financial situation of the Indian manufacturers,” said Gyanesh Choudhary, chief executive of module manufacturer Vikram Solar.They also worry the duty has been imposed for too short a period. The commissioning deadline for most auctioned solar projects is about 24 months.“Developers who win projects today won’t buy modules till close to the commissioning date, by which time the duty will have fallen to just 15%. There is no incentive for developers to buy from us now,” said a module manufacturer on condition of anonymity.","Jan 03, 2019, 07:43 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/safeguard-duty-on-imported-solar-components-fails-to-help-local-manufacturers/articleshow/67358418.cms
LG to step up its game to stay no. 1 in white goods,LG said it will continue to focus on all business segments to maintain its market leadership.,"Kolkata: India’s largest white goods maker, LG Electronics India, reported a 14% jump in its net profit to Rs 1,454.2 crore in 2017-18, extending its lead as the country’s second most profitable consumer electronics maker after Samsung.The South Korean firm, in its regulatory disclosures to the Registrar of Companies (RoC), said FY18 revenue from operations, including other income, was Rs 16,059 crore against Rs 16,220.3 crore in 2016-17. The revenue is not comparable over last year due to transition to the new GST regime during the fiscal.LG said in the disclosure that until June 30, 2017, sale of products included the amount of excise duty recovered on sales of Rs 481.2 crore whereas for financial year ended March 31, 2017, total excise duty recovered was of Rs 1,565.3 crore. GST became effective from July 1, 2017.The company said home appliances and air-conditioner businesses in 2017-18 was worth Rs 10,903 crore whereas television and home theatre divisions brought in Rs 4,546 crore in revenue.LG said it will continue to focus on all business segments to maintain its market leadership.An email sent to LG India remained unanswered till Wednesday press time.In contrast, Samsung India sales were Rs 61,065 crore last fiscal led by smartphones which account for over 60% of its revenue. Industry executives said that the impact of excise duty on Samsung’s revenue under the earlier tax regime was lower since excise duty on smartphones was 1% while for LG, which is dominant in white goods, excise was 12.5% on MRP with 35% abatement.The consumer electronics industry grew 5-6% last fiscal with growth rate impacted due to the transition to GST regime which increased net taxation effect by around 3%. This fiscal, the industry growth rate is higher with the 10% cut on GST rates for small screen TV, refrigerators and washing machines which led to price drops.Though rival Samsung India’s net profit dipped 11% in 2017-18, it is more-than-double of LG India at Rs 3,712.7 crore driven by the smartphone business where it is the largest by sales. Apple India more-than-doubled its net profit in 2017-18 to Rs 897 crore. Others like Whirlpool India’s net profit in FY18 was Rs 350 crore, Voltas India Rs 501 crore, Sony India Rs 110 crore, Blue Star Rs 142 crore and Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Rs 100 crore. LG’s profit in India is much more than the smartphone makers such as Xiaomi and Lenovo-Motorola, while Oppo and Vivo recorded losses.LG, however, did not report sales of its struggling mobile phone business last fiscal unlike the year before. The company said it has started in-house production of LED TV module to reduce costs and also developed exclusive microwave oven models for ecommerce sales.By market share, LG India leads in direct cool refrigerators, washing machines and microwave ovens and is the second-largest player in LED televisions and airconditioners.","Jan 03, 2019, 07:34 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/lg-to-step-up-its-game-to-stay-no-1-in-white-goods/articleshow/67358449.cms
Donald Trump takes dig at PM Modi for funding 'library' in strife-torn Afghanistan,Trump brought up India's aid at a cabinet meeting as he defended his push for the US to invest less overseas.,"US President Donald Trump took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for funding a ""library"" in Afghanistan, saying it is of no use in the war-torn country as he criticised India and others for not doing enough for the nation's security.In his first Cabinet meeting of the year on Wednesday, Trump asked India, Russia, Pakistan and other neighbouring countries to take responsibility for Afghanistan's security as he defended his push for the US to invest less overseas.Trump reffered to Prime Minister Modi as an example of how world leaders are talking about their contributions that were nowhere near the ""billions of dollars"" the US was spending.Trump referred to his friendly terms with Modi, but appeared critical of a ""library"" funded by India in Afghanistan. It was unclear to which ""library"" project Trump was referring to. India has been actively involved in reconstruction efforts in war-ravaged Afghanistan. It has committed about USD 3 billion in assistance to Afghanistan since US-led forces toppled the Taliban regime after the September 11, 2001 attacks.""I could give you an example where I get along very well with India and Prime Minister Modi. But he is constantly telling me, he built a library in Afghanistan. Library! That's like five hours of what we spend (in Afghanistan),"" Trump told his cabinet colleagues. ""And he (Modi) tells me. He is very smart. We are supposed to say, oh thank you for the library. Don't know who's using it (the library) in Afghanistan. But it's one of those things. I don't like being taken advantage of,"" he said. “I say this, India. (I have) great relationship with Prime Minister Modi. He is a great gentleman and a great man and he's done a fantastic job. He has brought the country together,” he said.Trump drew a comparison between the expenses being borne by the US and other countries in the Afghan peace efforts.Stating that ""massively wealthy countries"" were using the US to subsidise their own forces, he said, ""A country sends us 200 soldiers to Iraq or sends us 100 soldiers from a big country to Syria or to Afghanistan and then they tell me 100 times, 'Oh, we sent you soldiers, we sent you soldiers'."" ""Why is not Russia there (in Afghanistan, fighting the Taliban)? Why isn't India there? Why isn't Pakistan there? Why are we (US) there? We are 6,000 miles away. But I don't mind. We want to help our people. We want to help other nations,"" Trump told reporters in response to a question.Asked if India's role in Afghanistan was going to be security related, Trump said, “I think India should be involved in Afghanistan. I mean I'll give you an example. You can talk about our generals. I gave our generals all of the money they wanted, they didn't do such a great job in Afghanistan. They've been fighting in Afghanistan for 19 years.""Trump last month moved to cut by half the 14,000-strong force in Afghanistan, calling for less spending overseas.Alluding in Wednesday's remarks to the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, Trump said: ""Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan."" Without going into details, Trump asserted that he is going to do work out something good in Afghanistan. “We are going to do something that's right.

"Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto back GST reduction on motorcycles but differ on timing",Auto bosses Pawan Munjal and Rajiv Bajaj want two-wheelers out of high GST bracket.,"New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp chairman Pawan Munjal urged the government to lower the goods and services tax (GST) rate on motorcycles and scooters to 18% from the current 28%, contending that they are not luxury goods but provide basic mobility to the masses.Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj also backed a reduction but suggested that it should be tied to the introduction of new models, adding that rationalising GST rates is not the only means of keeping consumer demand steady amid an overall increase in prices due to the implementation of safety and emission norms. Manufacturers should also look at technological solutions to address the cost-value equation, Bajaj said.“Given that two-wheelers provide basic mobility to the masses, there is an urgent need to reduce the GST rate on two-wheelers from the 28% bracket of luxury goods to that of 18% for mass usage items,” said Munjal, who heads India’s biggest two-wheeler maker. His statement came ahead of the GST Council meeting scheduled for January 10.Munjal said the implementation of new safety norms and the transition to BS VI emission standards will raise the cost of two-wheelers, putting pressure on “extremely cost-sensitive commuters” for whom the two-wheeler is a lifeline. The reduction in tax, he added, would not only provide much-needed relief to two-wheeler customers across the country but is also imperative for ensuring growth in the domestic automobile industry.“This will provide relief to millions of two-wheeler customers across the country, as well as the entire value chain dependent on the sector,” Munjal said. “It is absolutely imperative to ensure growth in the auto sector to create and sustain inclusive economic growth.”  Bajaj said price wasn’t the only factor when it came to growth.“It’s not really a counter view,” he told ET. “I’m only saying two things... Price is not the sole dimension of the problem, else the sports segment wouldn’t be growing at 25%... so perhaps the mid-commuter segment needs more application of imagination in terms of technology and quality.” Bajaj is the fourth largest two-wheeler maker after Hero, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India and TVS Motor Co.Any reduction in tax rates would be beneficial, said Bajaj, adding that timing it right would help.“It will be a win-win solution to time any GST reduction with the safety or emission norms to mitigate the significant cost-up that’s inevitable,” Bajaj said. “Doing so separately would actually make things much worse for a while before making it hopefully better.”Overall, Munjal said 2018 had been a challenging year. While continuing volatility in currency and commodities slowed growth, geopolitical and trade conflicts also affected sentiment across the world.In the domestic market, Munjal said the increased cost of two-wheeler insurance ahead of the festive season and a liquidity crunch hit overall growth in the third quarter.He’s looking forward to a turnaround in the remaining months of the fiscal year with Lohri and Sankranti being celebrated in many parts of the country coupled with improved liquidity in the market.In calendar year 2018, Hero Moto-Corp sold 8 million bikes and scooters, registering a growth of 11% over 2017. Bajaj Auto grew sales by 29% to sell 3.2 million motorcycles between April and December 2018. Hero MotoCorp sold 6 million units in the nine months to December.","Jan 03, 2019, 08:43 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/two-wheelers-three-wheelers/two-wheels-of-india-inc-not-aligned-on-gst-cut-timing/articleshow/67358519.cms
"Indices fall on China woes, Nifty slips below 10,800",,"Mumbai: Indian stock indices slumped 1 per cent on Wednesday, ending their five day winning run, as weak reading of China’s manufacturing data signaled slowing growth in the world’s second largest economy weighed on sentiment across markets in Asia. Lower domestic tax collection and weak monthly vehicle sales also contributed to the weakness in the market.The BSE Sensex ended down 363 points, or 1 per cent, at 35,891.52 while the Nifty ended down 117.60 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 10,792.50.Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs 621 crore, provisional data showed. Domestic institutional investors were also net sellers Wednesday, dumping shares worth Rs 226 crore. Vedanta and Tata Steel were the worst performers on the Sensex with both stocks falling more than 4 per cent as CLSA downgraded them citing deteriorating Chinese demand outlook. Mahindra & Mahindra extended losses from previous day on disappointing December sales, ending down 4 per cent. Other automakers such as Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto slipped 1-3 per cent.Overall, Asian stock indices fell on Wednesday, in the range of 0.3-2.8 per cent, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index witnessing the steepest fall. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ index for December fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, marking the first contraction since May 2017.Market experts believe that global issues will continue to dominate the market direction in the near term, what with the threat of escalation of US-China trade issues continuing and the continued partial government shutdown in Washington.“Global issues will dominate the first three months and the elections will be in focus in the three months after that. Both factors will keep the markets volatile in the first-half of the year,” said Vaibhav Sanghavi, co-chief investment officer at Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies.“Global data is showing that growth will not be robust and with global economic growth slowing, markets are likely to feel the discomfort as well,” said Sanghavi.The 3 per cent drop in GST collections from the previous month left investors worried on the local front as it would mean government revenues taking a hit.“For the 9MFY19 (April-December) period, the government has collected Rs 8.7 trillion(8.7 lakh crore) in GST, a run-rate of Rs 968 billion (96,800 crore)/ month. However, this is far short of the Rs 1.12 trillion (1.12 lakh crore) per month estimated in the Centre’s FY19 budget,” said CLSA. “GST collections are thus set for a Rs 1.8 trillion miss for FY19,” the brokerage added.Nischal Maheshwari, CEO-institutional equities & advisory at Centrum Broking, said he is not worried much about the fall in GST collections as the drop is not significant.“The market fall is largely due to global markets and clearly there are global economic slowdown concerns. Indian markets cannot go up when world markets are falling but I believe they will fare better as oil prices have come down,” said Maheshwari.

Lava welcomes tweaks in ecommerce FDI policy,The tweaks to the ecommerce policy included barring online marketplaces from signing exclusive deals for products on their platforms.,"Lava International Ltd has said the recent tightening of the FDI policy in ecommerce will create a level playing field among handset makers, and added that it has overcome its tough phase where it had to delay salaries, and is now even planning to expand its overseas presence by investing about Rs 150 crore.“This will benefit Lava since our discounts on online and offline are the same,” Hari Om Rai, co-founder of Lava International, told ET. “This step will create a level playing field since more than 250,000 retailers were getting impacted by the cash burn method of online players.”The tweaks to the ecommerce policy included barring online marketplaces from signing exclusive deals for products on their platforms. It also directed that a single vendor can sell a maximum of 25% of its inventory on an ecommerce platform. Analysts said the new rules could take away the advantage from online focused players such as Xiaomi, Honor and Realme which from February 1, will need to increasingly depend on the offline channel for growth.Lava, and other Indian players such as Micromax, had put their bets mostly on the offline retail channel and lost out to those who were strong online and took advantage of huge discounts available on ecommerce platforms to increase market share rapidly.With sales falling rapidly, Lava had delayed employee salaries for November and disbursed it in two parts. But reports suggest that it has now made payments to suppliers in full during the same period.“It was a short-term thing, and the intent was to inform employees about delays in a transparent manner. Everything is sorted now, and we are on track,” said Sunil Raina, president, and business head, Lava International.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesThe company has spent the last year building manufacturing capabilities, including SMT lines, for printed circuit board assembly, besides improving its hold on the supply chain. “We now have in-house design capability, and the distribution is also strong,” said Raina.Lava now plans to invest around Rs 150 crore to expand in the African region and countries such as Russia and Uzbekistan, in 2019, backed by its sub-$200 handset portfolio which comprises both feature and smartphones, the executive said.“There is a large global opportunity. In this category, around 1.2 billion units are sold globally. In the next two months, we will be entering five African countries,” Raina said.Having entered Egypt last year, the company is now getting into countries like Kenya, Ghana and Ivory Coast, and will also enter countries such as Russia, Georgia and Uzbekistan later this year.Raina said that Lava is also evaluating the possibility to establish a manufacturing unit in Uzbekistan. “We have an invitation from the government of Uzbekistan to set up a manufacturing unit, and will consider this to cover the entire region.”","Jan 03, 2019, 07:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/lava-welcomes-tweaks-in-ecommerce-fdi-policy/articleshow/67358531.cms

All the hours in the gym can quickly come undone if you are not careful about what you consume. Hike founder Kavin Bharti Mittal recognises this and supplements his daily workouts with a strict diet.He recently shared with ETPanache how he streamlined his dietary intake in 2018. “Approximately 50-60 per cent of my food [intake] is now plant-based.

It’s basically fasting between previous night’s dinner to next day’s lunch, skipping a meal (breakfast) in between. “It’s incredible how effective this is. The body doesn’t need as much food as one thinks,” he said. He does, however, allow himself an occasional cheat day (one every two weeks or so). But he prefers to utilise them when he is travelling. “Pizza and chocolate chip cookies are my go-to. But it’s tough to get really good chocolate cookies that are gluten free in India.

Oil prices drop amid currency and stock market turmoil,,"SINGAPORE; Oil prices fell by more than one per cent on Thursday amid volatile currency and stock markets, and as analysts warned of an economic slowdown for 2019. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $45.83 per barrel at 0120 GMT, down 71 cents, or 1.5 per cent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures were down 51 cents, or 0.9 per cent, at $54.40 per barrel.

"Star India wants more buck for its IPL bang, begins pitch","Broadcaster said to be looking at 15% increase in viewership and ad revenue from 2019 edition, schedule and venue for which is yet to be announced.","MUMBAI: The schedule and venue of the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be announced only after the dates of the general elections are out, but the media rights holder of the cash-rich league, Star India, has started tapping the market with its IPL coverage plan seeking advertisers’ support.As per multiple media agency executives who have seen these presentations, Star India is looking up to 15% increase in viewership as well as ad revenues.“Unlike last season, when Star went to market too late and kept the prices very high, this time, Star started to make presentations to media agencies in late November and early December. There is major thrust on regional as well as Hotstar,” said one of the executives who did not wish to be named.Further, there’s discussion going on internally on whether or not to live telecast the matches on a Hindi mass entertainment channel. “We are yet to take a final call on airing IPL on movie or general entertainment channel. The decision will be taken after seeing the uptake on sports channels under the new tariff order regime. We are the only network providing sports channels in the basic bouquet,” a source in Star India told ET.Interestingly, Star India, which had promised a reach of 700 million viewers via TV and digital for IPL last year, was against airing matches on Hindi mass entertainment channels. Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), the previous rights holder, had always aired the matches on Set Max, the Hindi movie channel.However, the low reach of the sports channels in the Hindi heartland had affected the reach of IPL in Hindi speaking markets last year, which forced the broadcaster to air the playoffs and final on Star Plus.Localisation & Regional FeedsLike last year, Star will continue to have six language (Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Bengali) feeds on TV and digital video player, Hotstar. There might be an addition of Marathi, but a decision is yet to be taken, sources said.Moreover, unlike last year, when Kannada, Telugu and Bengali feeds were aired on Star Suvarna Plus, Star Maa Movies and Star Jalsha, respectively, as Star did not have sports channels in these languages, this time, the broadcaster will use newly launched regional sports channels Star Sports 1 Kannada and Star Sports 1 Telugu.Thrust on HotstarSources within Star informed that last season’s viewership on Hotstar had surprised the broadcaster and thus, this time, there is even more thrust on the digital platform. Hotstar will add integrations and innovations like geo-targeting, in app ordering, and group chats.“The idea is to make Hotstar more personalised and interactive for a consumer. The new features will allow a viewer to form and chat within group, order from within the app and advertisers can also have more personalised targeting,” said another source with direct knowledge of the development.Advertisers’ DilemmaIt is learned that Star is expecting at least 15% increase in ad revenue over last year, when it made Rs 1,750 crore across TV and Hotstar. However, media agency experts believe that getting a significant jump will not be easy.Ashish Bhasin, chairman and CEO - South Asia at Dentsu Aegis Group, said that IPL remains the most sought after media property and has a huge fan following, but there is not much scope for price increase next year.“IPL has proved its worth year-on-year, but given the current market scenario and the fact that Star has already taken a major price hike this year, I don’t anticipate any significant hike for IPL 2019,"" Bhasin said.Another issue for Star will be the fact that IPL will be sandwiched between two major events -- general elections and the ICC Cricket World Cup.“There are three big events and all in close proximity -- elections, IPL and the World Cup. I feel Star should have a combo offer for advertisers for IPL and World Cup as both the properties are with them,” said Sandeep Goyal, founder of Mogae Group.Goyal said that if Star plans a combo, it will work best for Star as well as advertisers. “It would give some comfort to advertisers as currently they are in two minds -- whether to advertise on IPL or World Cup.”","Jan 03, 2019, 09:15 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/star-india-wants-more-buck-for-its-ipl-bang-begins-pitch/articleshow/67358595.cms
Over 80% stocks see no LTCG tax after sub-zero returns,,"MUMBAI: The reintroduction of long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax for listed equities had little impact in 2018 with Bloomberg data showing 862 out of the 1,058 stocks of BSE Allcap index turned negative returns since January 31, 2018 — the benchmark date for capital gains calculation.The deep correction in the mid- and small-cap stocks left investors with little capital gains from over 80 per cent of the shares.Investors who choose to sell these 862 stocks at the current market prices will not have to shell out a single penny on LTCG tax. However, investors will see profits reduced in at least 100 counters including popular names such as V-Mart, Nestle, Bata, Excel Industries and Indiabulls Ventures.Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Adani Power Ltd  moved up by 2 in 3 months on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »The LTCG tax was reintroduced in the FY19 Union Budget to shore up tax collection and curb the misuse of the beneficial treatment given to listed equities. LTCG is incurred while selling shares that the investor has held for more than 12 months. A tax rate of 10 per cent is applicable on sale of such shares.On the other hand, if an investor is selling shares held for less than a year, short-term capital gains tax at 15 per cent is applicable.STOCKS THAT COULD SEE STEEP LTCG TAXIn the BSE Allcap index, 24 stocks gained more than 50 per cent since January 31, 2018, and investors booking profits in these could see capital gains tax considerably reducing their returns. For instance, if an investor sold 1,000 shares of Bata held for over a year, LTCG tax of Rs 42,000 would be levied. Similarly, investors could incur LTCG tax of Rs 95,300 for every 1,000 shares of Bajaj Finance sold at current market prices, data showed.V Mart, Indiabulls Ventures, Adani Power and Avenue Supermarts are among other known stocks where investors could incur a substantial tax outgo if they choose to exit.HOW MUCH TAX AND ON WHAT?As per the new rules, a capital gains tax of 10 per cent is applicable on any sale of shares which have been held for more than 12 months. This rate comes without any indexation benefit. The purchase price for the calculations varies depending on when the shares were purchased. If the shares were purchased any time before January 31, 2018, the closing price of the stock as on January 31 would be considered as the purchase price. However, if the shares have been bought after January 31, the original purchase price will be considered. The idea behind such arrangement is called grandfathering and is aimed to avoid retrospective taxation.IPO INVESTORSHowever, investors who put money in 2018 IPOs have to clearly factor in the LTCG outgo if and when they choose to sell since the LTCG outgo could be significantly higher than anticipated. The beneficial January 31 rate is applicable to only those companies whose shares were listed as on January 31. For the ones which were unlisted as on January 31 and have subsequently floated IPOs, the January 31 benefit will not be applicable since their publicly traded price is unavailable.Experts said, in such cases, original cost of acquisition or fair market value would be considered, which could be much lower than the market prices and hence quantum of capital gains could be significantly higher. Investors should consult their wealth advisor or charted accountant to figure the exact tax outgo.

"Economic concerns boost bonds, yen; Wall Street recovers","Bank and energy shares, which have been especially hard-hit in recent sell-offs.","NEW YORK: Weak Chinese and European economic data weighed on stocks around the world and boosted safe-haven Treasuries and the Japanese yen on Wednesday, though Wall Street shares edged higher as investors took advantage of cheaper shares to ring in the new year. Chinese factory activity contracted for the first time in more than two years, according to a private survey. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone also reached its lowest level since February 2016, and France's PMI fell in December for the first time in two years. Concerns about the flagging global economy contributed to US stocks posting a loss in 2018 for the first time in a decade. The US benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped as much as 1.6 per cent on the data, but later moved higher in choppy trading and ended up 0.13 per cent. Bank and energy shares, which have been especially hard-hit in recent sell-offs, were among the biggest gainers. But while cyclical stocks rose, defensive shares fell. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta, said that divergence was likely driven by investors' seeking to rebalance their portfolios by looking for undervalued stocks ""It's a normal shifting in position, regardless of the data today,"" Lerner said. ""We're seeing a 'January effect' on areas of the market that have sold hard."" Energy shares also benefited from a jump in oil prices, which climbed as US stocks recovered. MSCI's gauge of stocks around the globe ended 0.26 per cent lower, as did Asian markets and the pan-European STOXX 600. Reflecting lingering investor nervousness, yields on US 10-year Treasury notes fell, hitting an 11-month low. However, the boost in oil prices pushed up yields on short-dated maturities, flattening the yield curve . An inverted yield curve is widely seen as an indicator of a future recession. ""The yield curve is signaling that something is wrong,"" said Matt Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments in Boston. ""The underlying economic data continues to suggest a slowdown."" The safe-haven Japanese yen reached a seven-month high against the dollar. Yet the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, advanced 0.7 per cent as the euro and sterling fell more than 1 per cent. The euro sank as a result of weak European manufacturing data, while concerns about Brexit negotiations weighed on sterling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.78 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 23,346.24, the S&P 500 gained 3.18 points, or 0.13 per cent, to 2,510.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.66 points, or 0.46 per cent, to 6,665.94. Benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes last rose 17/32 in price to yield 2.6328 per cent, from 2.691 per cent late on Monday.

View Stock Analysis »In the festive season, the BSE Auto index trailed the BSE Sensex by 7 per cent. Eicher Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti, and Ashok Leyland have fallen 3-17 per cent in the past three months.Moderation in sales means only 5-8 per cent growth in the projected earnings of the listed automakers for the current fiscal year. Hence, their valuation premium compared with the longterm averages could further narrow. The price-earnings multiple of the BSE Auto index, based on the next twelve months’ earnings, dropped 9 per cent to 17.4 in the past three months.  Valuation declines could be steeper at Eicher Motor and Maruti Suzuki. Earlier, the Street had considered the moderation in demand for the Royal Enfield as one-off, but declines in the past two months point to a likely stagnation in underlying demand. Eicher Motors fell 9 per cent on Wednesday after it reported lower than expected volumes — for the second consecutive month.Eicher Motors has trimmed its production guidance to 9.25 lakh units for FY19 from 9.5 million announced earlier. Average monthly sales of Royal Enfield have been 70,000 in the past nine months of the current fiscal year. Given soft underlying demand due to higher cost of ownership and competition from the recently launched Jawa, Royal Enfield might face challenges in raising sales to 90,000-plus units in the next three months. Analysts are pencilling in volume of 8.6-8.9 lakh units for the current fiscal year, a growth of 3-8 per cent YoY. A singledigit volume growth could be the first since 2010 at Royal Enfield. The cut in volume growth to 3-8 per cent in FY19 from 15 per cent at the beginning of the year has resulted in projected EPS reduction to Rs 852 from Rs 960, a drop of 10 per cent.Volume growth at the largest twowheeler maker Hero MotoCorp has also not been very encouraging. Volumes fell 4 per cent in December. The challenges can be gauged from the fact that Hero MotoCorp’s Chairman Pawan Munjal urged the government to bring down the GST on two-wheelers to 18 per cent from 28 per cent to revive consumer demand.Separately, car sales growth has decelerated in the past four months. India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki saw its volumes increase 6.5 per cent in the first nine months of FY19, and growth since July has been either negative or in low single digits.Given the weakness in the underlying trend, Maruti’s management lowered its growth guidance to 8 per cent from double-digits at the beginning of the year. Maruti’s consensus EPS has been cut by 12 per cent to Rs 286 per share from Rs 327 in the past three months.

However, target price for Vedanta has been cut to Rs 250 from Rs 300 while target price for Coal India has been reduced to Rs 310 from Rs 360 by CLSA.2018 was a tough year for commodities despite decent global growth led by concerns on Chinese demand, escalating trade wars and benign winter cuts in China, said CLSA.The brokerage said the calendar year 2019 is likely to offer little respite because of the deteriorating Chinese demand outlook.“...India’s steel market is on the cusp of multi-year tightening due to insufficient capacity additions and we expect imports to rise sharply in coming years. However, the deterioration in global steel industry outlook is weighing down on Indian steel prices, weakening the earnings outlook of the steel companies,” said CLSA.The brokerage is relatively more positive on Coal India and Vedanta.The brokerage cut FY20-FY21 EPS estimates for Vedanta by 22-23 per cent on lower oil prices and stronger rupee but added that the company has decent volume growth, better earnings trajectory and an attractive 8 per cent dividend yield, it said.CLSA sees Coal India as a defensive play amid the global headwinds in the resources sector.While production growth for Coal India has been patchy but demand outlook for coal in India remains healthy, said CLSA.

Why a slump in US may not be bad news for Indian IT,Indian firms were among top winners in last two US recessions as cos outsourced work offshore to cut costs.,"Bengaluru: A possible slowdown in the US economy is unlikely to hit the growth momentum for Indian IT services companies, say analysts, because their clients in the largest market would outsource more digital technology-led services that they have built over the past couple of years by also hiring local workforce in the US.Companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro, besides midtier firms like L&T Infotech and CSS Corp are already disrupting their business models where they look at building value through productivity and IP, moving away from the traditional cost-arbitrage model. “If it is a moderate downturn, given the digital imperative, hopefully Indian IT can ride it,” Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice-president at Nasscom, told ET. “Digital technology spend is significantly low and I think the headroom for growth is much higher… Banks and financial services companies are already thinking about what can be done to invest in these technologies to deal with such change.”Last week, Goldman Sachs cut the US economy growth forecast for the first half of 2019 to 2% from 2.4%, saying it was still “not worried about a recession”. While the bank was optimistic of a soft landing of the US economy, a Duke University survey in December of US CFOs claimed nearly half the chief financial officers expected the country to hit a recession by end-2019. The worst-case projections included a fall in capital spending with flat hiring.  Indian firms were among the biggest beneficiaries in the last two recessions as US companies outsourced work offshore for costs, forcing their global rivals such as IBM and Capgemini to replicate their model by ramping up their workforce significantly in India. It also saw US firms set up their captive centres in India, a trend that is being witnessed again in the last two years as they look for talent in newer areas such as digital and analytics.“I do see an increase in IT-centric work going to some of the Indianheritage services providers, but not only to save on costs, also to contract for project work in complex areas such as automation, analytics and machine learning as the need for skilled resources becomes increasingly desperate from US and European businesses,” said Phil Fersht, CEO, HfS Research.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesAfter a slowdown in business in the last three years due to technology shifts to digital and cloud and protectionism, Indian firms are back on the growth mode this fiscal year. It is being led by TCS, which is expected to report doubledigit growth this fiscal year and the next on the back of multibillion-dollar orders.""In the last economic crisis in 2008-2009, offshore outsourcers held on fairly well initially, and made adjustments to boost revenue and profitability. Hiring continued to happen although at a reduced pace. However, towards the fag end of the recession, it was clear that IT firms were witnessing pricing pressures and slowdown in business velocity,"" said Manish Tandon, chief executive of CSS Corp. He added that the industry had shown tremendous resilience in the past and reinvented itself through flexible business models.""Hence, it might emerge as a strong partner for global organisations to wade through their economic pressures.""Pinkesh Shah, an executive board member and faculty at California-headquartered Institute of Product Leadership, believes “the economic concerns are real” and this could be more of “an opportunity than a threat” to deliver engaged value to their clients in the US and Europe. “Look at what HCL Tech has done with their product client companies like Symantec and what Cognizant has done with Intuit — they are not just merely doing low-end outsourcing work but co-owning the product roadmap and prioritisation and actively participating in their productising process,” said Shah.","Jan 03, 2019, 01:39 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/why-a-slump-in-us-may-not-be-bad-news-for-indian-it/articleshow/67358723.cms
IOT Infra plans to manufacture bio-CNG in Tamil Nadu,"IOT, a 50:50 joint venture, has been generating power from biogas at its plant at Namakkal.","Mumbai: IOT Infrastructure and Energy Services, a joint venture of state run-Indian Oil Corporation and Oiltanking GmbH of Germany, is tweaking its biogas plant to manufacture bio-CNG for vehicles and has plans to set up more greenfield projects for the clean auto fuel.“We have been running a power plant on biogas and realised that if we managed to increase its methane concentration, we could convert it into bio-CNG for automobiles. This would directly help in reducing India’s dependence on liquid fuel,” Vivek Venkatachalam, managing director, IOT, told ET.IOT, a 50:50 joint venture, has been generating power from biogas at its plant at Namakkal. Now, with an investment of Rs 25 crore, and implementation of a technology developed by IOC’s research and development team, the plant will be converted to a bio-CNG unit with a daily output of 12,000 kg.“Our Namakkal unit would start selling bio-CNG from July. Besides this plant, we are looking to set up another five greenfield projects in the next 2-3 years, for which we are in talks with companies which have agri waste that can be our feedstock,” Venkatachalam said. The cost of each of these units would be Rs 50-65 crore, he said.“We are also talking to oil marketing companies to sell the bio-CNG. The idea is to set up the manufacturing units in clusters where feedstock is available ad then sell the product in areas close to it,” Venkatachalam.","Jan 03, 2019, 08:05 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/iot-infra-plans-to-manufacture-bio-cng-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/67358665.cms
"Traders expect Vijaya, Dena Bank shares to fall today",The share swap ratio was announced after the stock markets closed on Wednesday. ,"The boards of three stateowned lenders Wednesday approved the share swap ratio ahead of their union, taking a crucial step in the proposed three-way merger involving Vijaya Bank, Dena Bank and the Bank of Baroda (BoB).The three boards approved the issuance of 110 BoB shares for every 1,000 held in Dena, and 402 BoB shares for every 1,000 shares held in Vijaya Bank.The share swap ratio was announced after the stock markets closed on Wednesday. All three banks announced the swap ratio to the exchanges almost simultaneously. A redressal committee, headed by retired Bombay High Court judge Pramod Kode, would address the grievances of minority shareholders who have been given 21 days, starting January 4, to file written grievances.BoB shares ended at Rs 119.40 apiece on Wednesday, while Vijaya Bank ended at Rs 51.05 per share and Dena Bank ended at Rs 17.95 per share.Going by Wednesday’s closing price, 1,000 Dena Bank shares are valued at Rs 17,950 while 110 BoB shares are valued at Rs 13,134. That would mean that Dena Bank was valued about 27 per cent lower than the closing price Wednesday.That difference for the profitable Vijaya Bank was lower, with 1,000 shares of the lender valued at Rs 51,050 while 402 BoB shares were valued at Rs 47,999, meaning a difference of 6 per cent.Traders expect the shares of both Dena and Vijaya Bank to fall on Thursday as investors sell the stocks to adjust them to the value of the swap ratio. With the uncertainty about the swap ratio over, the focus will now be on the progress report of the most complex bank merger in India.“From now on, the tough days will begin because pulling off a merger of this magnitude will be very complex. The merger of both SBI associate banks and Kotak’s acquisition of ING Vysya Bank took a few quarters to be digested,” said Asutosh Mishra, head of institutional equity research at Ashika Stock Broking. “This is far more complex than that because no one, not even the bank management, can predict how the numbers for the combined entity will look like. The best thing for investors is to stay away from these stocks until the uncertainty of the merger is out of the way.”  ","Jan 03, 2019, 08:07 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/traders-expect-vijaya-dena-bank-shares-to-fall-today/articleshow/67358771.cms
India to host two-day meeting of Arab League,"If Syria is admitted to the grouping in the intervening period it could be among the participants at the meet, said people aware of the matter.","NEW DELHI: India will host foreign ministers of 22 Arab League nations in Delhi at a two-day meet from January 31 in the first such engagement in recent years with the grouping of West Asian and North African countries, and the State of Palestine. If Syria is admitted to the grouping in the intervening period it could be among the participants at the meet, said people aware of the matter. They said that India’s initiative signals continuation of the Narendra Modi government’s efforts to boost ties with the Arab world even as it has separately stepped up engagement with Israel. Prominent items on the agenda of the meet are the prevailing conflict in West Asia, Palestine issue, counterterrorism, defence partnership, Indian energy interests and welfare of diaspora, said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.Syria’s membership of the Arab League was suspended in 2011. But India, one of the five observer members of the grouping, maintained its diplomatic mission in Damascus and continued its counterterrorism cooperation and economic ties with the country. Syria, on its part, has been against a strong anti-India position on Kashmir in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Some other Arab League member states, which are also OIC members, have also favoured a similar position on the Kashmir issue. Since 2015, India has been engaging more intensely with the Arab World, with the Prime Minister and external affairs minister undertaking several visits to the region and hosting its leaders including the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince at the 2017 Republic Day celebrations. Modi, preceded by the then President Pranab Mukherjee, also visited Palestine, the first Indian PM to do so.While India de-hyphenated ties with Israel and the Arab World, with Modi becoming the first Indian PM to visit Israel and later hosting PM Benjamin Netanyahu within six months of his visit, the country also elevated ties with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Jordan to the next level. Modi’s recent meeting with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia led to a decision on the part of Saudi Arabia to scale up investments in India. Simultaneously, India has continued to engage with Qatar and expand bilateral energy ties, while Doha has reciprocated with visa-free entry for Indians.In North Africa, Morocco has emerged as India’s steadfast partner, with the two sides concluding more than 40 pacts in the past two years. Hamid Ansari visited Morocco and Algeria during his terms as Vice President. Ties with post-revolution Tunisia have been strengthened as well, and the Egyptian President has visited India twice since 2015, opening a new chapter in security and investment ties. Another Arab League member, Djibouti, in Horn of Africa, hosted President Ram Nath Kovind last year.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:00 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-to-host-two-day-meeting-of-arab-league/articleshow/67358688.cms

"Elara bullish on midcap IT stocks, picks L&T Infotech, Zensar & NIIT",The brokerage said new technologies are eroding long-held benefits to scale.,"Brokerage Elara Capital has initiated coverage on mid-sized technology companies with ‘buy’ ratings on three stocks—L&T Infotech, Zensar Technologies and NIIT Technologies. The brokerage said new technologies are eroding long-held benefits to scale, which had resulted in large technology companies outpacing their smaller peers for two decades. “With new technology, whether it is API-led application development or Cloud migration of a business unit’s applications, large project teams are no longer necessary,” said Elara’s analysts Ravi Menon and Ashish Agrawal in a report on Wednesday. The brokerage has an accumulate rating on Persistent Systems, while on Mphasis, it has a sell rating citing high execution risk and unreliable reported metrics.L&T InfotechCMP*: Rs 1,703 Target Price**: Rs 2,130Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  NIIT Ltd  moved up by 1 in a month on a 10-point scale.

Elara forecasts earnings growth of 20.9 per cent and revenue growth of 21.6 per cent on a compounded basis from FY18 to FY21. The stock’s premium valuations are justified, it said. “With higher growth, a proven ability to scale up clients better than peers and a broad set of growth drivers across all four dimensions, we think LTI deserves a significant P/E premium vs peers, due to the likelihood of a much longer runway of growth,” said Elara.Zensar TechnologiesCMP*: Rs 231.20 Target Price**: Rs 280Elara expects the company’s earnings to increase 36.3 per cent, revenues to grow 23.6 per cent and operating profit margins to expand 425 basis points from FY18 to FY21. The brokerage said acquisitions continue to be used as “tip-of-the-spear” to get into new accounts and add vertical-specific capabilities, such as Guidewire implementation and support. “We expect the current margins are suppressed due to investments in enhancing capability. While we expect the investments to continue at the present level in absolute terms, we think the company should see operating leverage for these investments,” the brokerage said.NIIT TechnologiesCMP*: Rs 1,152 Target Price**: Rs 1,410Elara said NIIT Tech is its second top pick after L&T Infotech citing the probability of significant earnings upgrade. “We see long runway of growth, given its demonstrated ability to add new client accounts and scale them to meaningful size,” the brokerage said. Elara said the stock could rerate once the company starts winning larger deals that will lead to in-line growth or growth ahead of peers. “We expect NIIT Tech to enjoy a slight premium to the peer group due to sustained growth and margin. The company is likely to evolve into a significantly larger firm and expect long-term earnings compounding as a result of that growth,” it said.

Boost for banks with big loans against property,RBI has allowed the scheme for restructuring of stressed assets with credit facilities not exceeding Rs 25 crore as on January 1.,"Mumbai: Banks with a larger share of loans against property are likely to benefit from the RBI’s latest relief on small value loans to micro and medium level companies and lenders like DCB Bank, Federal Bank, City Union Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank could see earnings improve, nudging them to open up credit lines to ease the freeze. RBI on Tuesday allowed a one-time restructuring of existing loans to MSMEs that are in default but ‘standard’ as on January 1, 2019, without an asset classification downgrade. The restructuring has to be implemented by March 31, 2020. RBI has allowed the scheme for restructuring of stressed assets with credit facilities not exceeding Rs 25 crore as on January 1. When borrowers fail to repay loans due to genuine reasons, lenders relax terms and conditions for repayments, known as restructuring in market parlance.“You needed some confidence building measures to lend each other,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets, IIFL Securities. “The RBI move has instilled just such confidence. Select banks will significantly do well in future as creditworthiness of small companies is likely to improve giving opportunity for credit expansion.”While BSE Sensex slumped 1%, BSE Bankex dipped 0.77%. Federal Bank shares rose 2% to close at ?94.85 on Wednesday. While DCB Bank shares fell marginally by 0.18%, City Union Bank shares slipped 0.21%. Bank shares fell on Wednesday on broader market trends.“The latest RBI move was in line with the government’s intention,”said Ashutosh K Mishra, head of research – institutional equity at Ashika Stock Broking. “This will help both credit flows and the holistic economy as this will add confidence among all banks, private and public. MSME loans mostly happen through loan against properties with banks like DCB, IndusInd, Kotak having larger share.”“Such banks’ earnings would be positively impacted over a period of time as the move will help in the long term,” he said. “Benefits of the latest MSME relief are likely to be derived over a long period of time in the form of improved GST compliance and resultant improvement in credit flows,” said Digant Haria, AVPresearch at Antique Stock Broking. The move will be interim relief for banks in the form of lower provisioning requirements.”“The twin impact of demonetisation and GST has impacted them negatively and this measure can ensure better credit flows,” he said.Banks can restructure loans only if such borrowing companies are GST compliant. This means, more companies are expected to come under GST regime, pushing up the government’s tax collections. A GST compliant company is seen as more creditworthy compared to non-complaint entities.","Jan 03, 2019, 08:22 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/boost-for-banks-with-big-loans-against-property/articleshow/67358901.cms

"PayPal’s revenue jumps 12x, thanks to its India arm",Digital payments company reports Rs 260-cr revenue for FY18 from Rs 21 crore last year ,"BENGALURU: US-headquartered digital payments company PayPal has reported an over twelve-fold jump in revenue generated by its Indian payments subsidiary to Rs 260 crore in financial year 2018 from Rs 21 crore in the previous year, as per data sourced from the corporate affairs ministry.The surge can be attributed to the opening of the domestic payments business by the company which had engaged only in crossborder transactions until November 2017.Net profit grew at a relatively modest pace during this period, up to Rs 2 crore from Rs 1.4 crore in the previous year.PayPal declined to comment on the filings, but a person privy to the information told ET on condition of anonymity that with revenue going up, the company had increased investments in India across heads including technology augmentation, expansion of headcount in India and a new office in Mumbai. The company, which has been among the most popular players for cross-border transactions, entered the fiercely-competitive domestic-payments business by entering into a partnership with online merchants such as Book-MyShow, MakeMyTrip, Yatra, Goibibo, FreshMenu and Box8 to allow Indian consumers to start using the PayPal wallet.“While the basic payment platform coupled with the security features are the same as in the US, we have added local modifications here like two factor authentication, etc., as per regulatory requirements,” said the person cited earlier.","Jan 03, 2019, 08:27 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/paypals-revenue-jumps-12x-thanks-to-its-india-arm/articleshow/67359017.cms

Dollar returns make a smart comeback in 2018,,"It makes sense for investors to track dollar returns of stocks and indices.

But since November, dollar returns have staged a smart comeback thanks to market’s gain and the rupee’s rise against the dollar. The Nifty has also performed much better, though overall performance for the year is still down due to the rupee’s weakness for much of the year.India and Indonesia lead emerging markets’ outperformance over developed markets in the past three months — the MSCI Emerging Markets index has outperformed the MSCI World index by 9 per cent.

"Gold gains on global growth fears, falling Asian stocks","US gold futures were up 0.4 per cent at $1,288.80 per ounce.
","BENGALURU: Gold prices inched up on Thursday as a dip in Asian equities and worries about a sharp global economic slowdown propelled demand for safer investments. FUNDAMENTALSSpot gold gained about 0.2 per cent to $1,286.62 per ounce at 0107 GMT, having earlier touched its highest since June 15 at $1,290.09.US gold futures were up 0.4 per cent at $1,288.80 per ounce.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was hovering about a one-week peak touched in the previous session.Shares in Asia fell and US stock futures dropped sharply after Apple Inc cut its revenue forecast for its latest quarter due in part to slowing growth in China, adding to concerns about a stuttering global economy.A meeting between US congressional leaders and President Donald Trump on Wednesday yielded no sign of an agreement to end a partial government shutdown, now in its 12th day, as the president stuck to his demand for $5 billion in funding for a border wall.Trump has asked leaders to return to the White House on Friday for talks aimed at ending the partial government shutdown, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday.Trump said on Wednesday he had received a ""great"" letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and would probably meet him again in the not-too-distant future as part of efforts to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons.Businesses in Britain's dominant services sector reported the slowest sales growth in two years during the final three months of 2018, another sign of a slowing economy ahead of Brexit, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Thursday.SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.97 per cent to 795.31 tonnes on Wednesday from 787.67 tonnes on Monday.

UP in favour of 12% hike in MSP for sugar to help farmers clear dues,This move can also help sugar mills clear the cane payment to farmers.,"Pune: India’s biggest sugar-producing state, Uttar Pradesh, appears to have favoured a 12 per cent increase in the government-set floor price for the sweetener even as farmers in another producing belt, Maharashtra, have begun agitations to secure payments for the cane already crushed at mills this season.“As 65 per cent of the sugar produced in the country is used by institutional buyers, if the MSP (minimum support price) of sugar is increased from Rs 29/kg to Rs 32.50/ kg, it would not affect the consumers that adversely,” Sanjay Bhoosreddy, principal secretary, Sugar Industry and Cane Development Department, Uttar Pradesh, said.“This move can also help sugar mills clear the cane payment to farmers,” he added.To be sure, cane arrears have been rapidly increasing across the country as prices of the sweetener remain subdued amid an anticipated supply glut.According to the Uttar Pradesh sugar commissionerate, sugar mills in the state have paid 40 per cent of the cane dues in the current year, while 96 per cent of the previous year’s dues have also been paid.In Maharashtra, sugar mills had paid Rs 1,469.5 crore of the total Rs 5,026 crore of dues until December 15, or about 29 per cent of the current year’s arrears.Significantly, a large number of sugar mills from Maharashtra haven’t paid any money to farmers even 50 days after buying their cane. The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, the main farmers’ organisation representing sugarcane growers in the state, resorted to violent agitations demanding payments. “If the cane dues are not paid, we will organise a massive morcha (protest march) to the headquarters of the sugar commissionerate on January 28,” said Raju Shetty, founder leader of the sanghatana.

India's science and tech centres double up as startup ideation hubs,"India’s science and technology institutions have become fertile grounds for startups, having built ecosystems that will help convert research projects quickly into commercial ventures.","The patient is a rectangular tabletop kept at about four feet high. The trainee doctor pushes a tube through a hole on its side, acting as a purported mouth of the patient. As the tube goes it through the gut, a screen lights up with realistic simulations of the mouth, through and the rest of the esophagus as the tubes moves into the stomach. The doctors feel resistance in their hands as they push the tube, just as in a real endoscopy procedure.The feeling of resistance is unique to this device, called EndoMymik, developed by the startup Mimyk from the Indian Institute of Science. Simulations like these are increasingly important for surgeons and interventional physicians around the world. Endoscopy training devices are made by other companies around the world, but Mimyk’s device is low cost and has the advantage of touch. It developed out of a PhD project of Shantanu Chakravarthy at the mechanical engineering department of IISc.Over the last five years, India’s science and technology institutions have become fertile grounds for generating startups. Almost always, these startups have formed with a business idea in mind, with the founders working backwards from the idea to develop the technology. Student startups were largely from undergraduate students, with the business idea often unrelated to the field of study of the students. It was rare for PhD students to set up companies, and even rarer for them to convert their research projects into companies. Now some students in top research institutions are doing exactly that.Two startups in IIT Madras have grown out of PhD projects, both biotechnology companies: Fibsol makes biofertilisers, and Yaathum Biotech develops rapid diagnostic kits. Parul Ganju continued her PhD work at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) by setting up Ahammune Biosciences, now incubated in Pune. At IIT Delhi, research during PhD has resulted in two healthcare companies: Valetude Health Premus and Cutting Edge Medical Devices. All of these have been set up in the last two years.Chakravarty had come to his PhD programme with clear intentions of working on haptics, or the science of touch. At the same time, GK Ananthasuresh, professor at the mechanical engineering department, had requests from the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology in Hyderabad to develop a simulation platform for endoscopy and other medical procedures. The two objectives met and Chakravarty started work under Ananthasuresh. “I spent my PhD years understanding how doctors perceive the sense of touch,” says Chakravarty.Once he understood that, developing a simulation device became a possibility. Simulating medical procedures realistically was a hard problem to solve, but Chakravarty had help from many quarters. A simulation device needed high quality graphics, and Chakravarty had help from Vijay Natarajan, professor at the Computer Science and Automation department in IISc.Computing tissue deformation in real time – for visual rendering – was not straightforward. Two companies provided simulation systems for doctors: CAE healthcare based in Montreal, Canada, and 3D systems based in South Carolina in the US. Chakarvarty had realized that the haptics and simulation provided by both companies were not good enough. In the training device Mimyk has built, doctors have auditory, tactile and visual inputs during a procedure simulation.Mimyk is expecting to enter a rapidlygrowing market later this year. The market research firm Markets and Markets estimates that global medical simulation market will increase to $2.57 billion by 2022, from $1.28 billion in 2017. Onefourth of doctors trained every year in the world is in India.Mimyk is the third company in IISc to have grown out of a PhD project in the last two years. The first one was PathShodh, which makes a hand-held clinical testing device. The second was BendFlex, a company that designs devices using novel and proprietary methods. BendFlex grew out of Ananthasuresh’s research group. PathShodh was from the nanoscience department. IISc expects more companies to develop out of its research. “Many of us here in IISc are keen on doing projects that have commercial or social value,” says Ananthasuresh.IISc has now built an ecosystem that will help to convert research projects quickly into commercial ventures. Space is available in the campus of its commercial arm, the Society for Innovation and Development (SID), across the road from the main campus. SID provides space, money and mentorship.The large infrastructure and varied expertise of IISc is useful for product development, as Mimyk found out. Nitin Shivshankar, PhD student from the computer science department, developed the graphics. Raghu Menon from the Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing helped with the product design.Funding is also available widely for early stages of startups. Mimyk got funding from the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyberphysical Systems at SID. The funding from Bosch was used to hire two PhD students, one of whom was Nitin Shivshankar, who joined the company when it was set up. After the company was set up, the Department of Biotechnology gave a grant of Rs 50 lakh. The government of Karnataka also gave Rs 50 lakh. Mimyk is on the verge of raising more money.It is the presence of this ecosystem – expertise, money, office space, mentorship – that is prompting faculty and students to select commercially-viable projects for research. If a research problem with commercial potential is solved, it is now easier than ever to convert it into a startup. With so many students and faculty now interested in entrepreneurship, it is possible for many complementary ideas being developed in the same lab. This is what happened at IIT Madras.Anant Raheja has joined IIT Madras as a PhD student in 2009. His research, to develop electrospinning nanofibers, was done under the supervision of two professors: TS Natarajan of the physics department and TS Chandra of biotechnology department. Electrospinning is a developing technique that uses electric charge to draw polymer fibres of extremely small diameter. It is a platform technology that has wide applications in many industries.During his PhD, he also worked on a project sponsored by the central government’s department of biotechnology. During this project, he hit on a method to embed microbes into the fibres. This was not immediately useful, and the results were shelved for a while. At the same time, S Kavitha was working a PhD under Chandra on using microbes to enhance the production of vitamins. When they were about to finish their PhDs, the commercial idea was evident to Anant and Kavitha: nanofibers with microbes in them. As a platform technology, it had many uses.Chandra had asked them to focus on agriculture first. “Agriculture is a multifaceted research area,” says Chandra. “It has opportunities in different directions.” Anant and Kavitha set up FiBSOL to commercialise their products, the first of which is a water-soluble and biodegradeable nanofiber. It has bacteria that can enhance the fixing of nitrogen in the soil, but the technology is useful to embed any kind of bacteria. “I have not seen such companies before,” says Chandra. “A lot of PhD work is basic academic work. Students have not had the motivation to apply their research.”With entrepreneurship being the current Zeitgeist, students are motivated to translate their own work, even if it means going a considerable distance. Parul Ganju did her PhD on skin biology at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi, working under its former director Rajesh Gokhale. Ganju was interested in the disease vitiligo, also known as leukoderma, characterized by white patches on the skin. The disease is often confused with leprosy. “I was surprised to learn how common it was,” says Ganju.During her PhD, Ganju identified metabolic pathways that are relevant to the development of the disease. There was no drug development programme for the disease anywhere, and Ganju decided to take the plunge based on her work.“This work cannot be done within the academia,” says Ganju. She got some molecules from Srinivas Reddy, a scientist at the National Chemical Laboratory, that showed efficacy against some targets in the pathways she identified. She moved to the NCL Venture centre, an incubation facility right next to NCL, and set up Ahammune Biosciences along with K Natarajan, a professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.The company got a Rs 50-lakh grant from the Department of Biotechnology. It has raised angel investments of Rs 8 crore. Ahammune is now doing the preclinical work on its patented molecules. Around 2% of the world population are supposed to have the disease. In some parts of India like Gujarat, the prevalence goes up to 8%. There is no treatment, and so the market is wide open for the company.Like IISc and IIT Madras, NCL Venture Centre has all that is required to push research startups quickly on the path to commercialization. The value of such incubation centres have not been lost on the students working for their PhD in the institutions nearby. Research startups are now doing something that has not been seen so far in the country: rapid translation of research from the lab to the market.","Jan 03, 2019, 11:51 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/features/entrepreneurs-born-under-the-microscope/articleshow/67359180.cms
Supreme Court to hear petition on Meghalaya miners rescue today,"The miners have been trapped for the last 16 days in a socalled rat hole mine, the type of which dot the terrain despite a top court-imposed ban on such mining.","New Delhi: The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday a public interest litigation that seeks to enlist army, navy and air force personnel in the efforts to rescue 15 miners trapped underground in a submerged coal mine in Meghalaya.The miners have been trapped for the last 16 days in a socalled rat hole mine, the type of which dot the terrain despite a top court-imposed ban on such mining.Though the state government has not called off the rescue operation yet, efforts have been hampered by lack of heavy equipment needed to pump out the water from the mine.Both the Union and the state governments are parties to the petition filed by lawyer Aditya N Prasad.The petition was mentioned on Wednesday before Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul. The bench then listed it for Thursday.The petition seeks a court order to immediately direct the armed forces to move in and rescue the trapped miners, a direction to the state to requisition high capacity self-priming pumps to flush out the water from the mine and a direction to Coal India Ltd to provide the necessary technical know-how, equipment and guidance immediately at the rescue site.The petition also urges the court to ensure that Coal India and the authorities prepare a standard operating procedure for rescue in mines and similar conditions.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in 2015 banned rat hole mining following allegations that it was turning rivers acidic in the state.Rat hole mining, a phenomenon unique to Meghalaya, is a mostly unscientific way of private mining involving digging of small holes to ferret out minerals, often with disastrous consequences for the environment and the ecology.Though the Supreme Court upheld the ban, rat hole mining continues unabated in Meghalaya.","Jan 03, 2019, 09:11 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/supreme-court-to-hear-petition-on-meghalaya-rescue-today/articleshow/67359307.cms
Stranded power units may get imported gas at subsidised rates,"The scheme will be similar to the one run between 2015-16 and 2016-17, based on financial support from the Power System Development Fund, sources said.","New Delhi: The government is working on a Rs 18,000-crore subsidy scheme under which it proposes to offer imported gas at subsidised rates to stranded and underutilised power projects.The scheme will be similar to the one run between 2015-16 and 2016-17, based on financial support from the Power System Development Fund, sources said.NTPC, Ratnagiri Gas & Power, Torrent Power, GVK Industries, Lanco Kondapalli, GMR Energy, Gujarat State Electricity Corp and CLP India got gas in previous rounds of auction.A cabinet secretary PK Sinha-led highlevel empowered committee had asked power and oil ministries to jointly frame a scheme for revival of gas-based power plants on lines of the earlier e-bid RLNG scheme. The proposal is now likely to be discussed by the ministries and put before a group of ministers (GoM) headed by finance minister Arun Jaitley.The GoM met for the first time on Wednesday and discussed a few recommendations made by the Sinha panel on coal supply to power plants.As per the scheme, the government is considering a gas auction mechanism for the electricity generating units by pooling any domestic gas with LNG and subsidising the tariffs to revive about 25,000 MW projects, an official said. Earlier, the government was considering pooling ONGC deep sea gas with LNG. Industry experts said calculated at a cost of the present RLNG price of $9 (about Rs 626) per mmBtu, electricity tariff at pooled price might drop to around Rs 5.90 per unit. “The government is looking at subsidising electricity tariffs by around Rs 1.75 per unit to make it affordable at about Rs 4.50 per unit,” he said.At present, all of the nearly 25,000 MW of operational gas-based capacity is stressed because of fuel supply constraints.Against a total requirement of 117 mmscmd, gas supply was only 30 mmscmd in 2017. Central Electricity Authority data showed 24,882 MW gas-based stations generated higher than the target in November and in the financial year so far. These operated at a capacity of 24.02% during April-November.An e-RLNG scheme was launched in March 2015 for two years, but discontinued after two rounds of aggressive bids from companies. Power companies have been urging the government to restart the scheme, arguing that about 7,500 MW capacity is completely stranded while the rest is stressed.","Jan 03, 2019, 08:58 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/stranded-power-units-may-get-imported-gas-at-subsidised-rates/articleshow/67358845.cms

Gold futures trade at a discount to spot rates,The futures closed at Rs 175/10 gm discount to the spot rate polled by MCX on Monday.,"The inversion in the bullion market, where future contracts have been trading at a discount to spot gold prices this week, is due largely to speculation that New Delhi would reduce the import levy on the metal in the interim budget ahead of the general elections. The MCX active gold futures contract, which slipped into a discount to the spot gold price on Monday, factors in a likely 1 per cent reduction in the import duty. On Monday, MCX February 5 expiry contract witnessed a sudden, intraday fall of 0.85 per cent, or Rs 271, to Rs 31,300 per 10 gm. The gold import duty is 10 per cent. The GST on gold is 3 per cent, setting the effective tax at 13 per cent. The discounts have narrowed since Monday, when the rumours first surfaced, pointing to a likely return to normality in the markets. The futures closed at Rs 175/10 gm discount to the spot rate polled by MCX on Monday. On Tuesday, the discount narrowed to Rs 109, and on Wednesday late evening, it was Rs 145. Bullion dealer Ganpat Mehta of Mehta Bullion at Zaveri Bazaar said the import duty was unlikely to be changed, and the gold futures would soon begin quoting at a premium to the spot price.  Sudheesh Nambiath, head of India Gold Policy Centre, said he didn’t see any “logic” of a duty cut, given the “current macroeconomic situation.” Gold futures normally trade at a premium to the metal’s spot price because of the carrying cost.","Jan 03, 2019, 09:12 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/gold-futures-trade-at-a-discount-to-spot-rates/articleshow/67359488.cms
View: Rafale critics glossed over urgency to acquire aircraft,"The first decision to buy the Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) was made nearly 17 years ago, but the first Rafale aircraft is scheduled to fly into India only in October 2019.","By G Mohan KumarRecently, when Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa stated that politics over defence acquisitions harmed the preparedness of India’s forces, he was perhaps expressing an anguish shared by the three services. As expected, his stout defence of the Rafale deal was not relished in certain political circles. The concern of the Chief of the Air Staff can be easily understood by anyone who has had a glimpse into the defence acquisitions of the last two decades.The last set of fighter aircraft of any class that India acquired in recent memory was the SU-30, mostly manufactured by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under licence from the Russian government. However, the delivery of these aircraft, which began at the turn of the century, is way behind schedule. Apart from the SU-30, the air force is heavily dependent on the aging fleet of MiG-21s, Jaguars and Mirage 2000s which have to be decommissioned in the coming years, leading to significant depletion of our fighter squadrons.The first decision to buy the Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) was made nearly 17 years ago, but the first Rafale aircraft is scheduled to fly into India only in October 2019. Despite these facts on record, the critics of the Rafale deal have conveniently glossed over the urgency to acquire aircraft to counter the build-up of air power by China. The timely decision of the NDA government to order two squadrons of Rafale fighters through an intergovernmental process to bolster India’s defence preparedness has been questioned. The procedure followed in the procurement process has withstood the scrutiny of the apex court, which also ruled that the plea of the petitioners to initiate an investigation did not have merit. The critics of the deal are clamouring for a JPC (joint parliamentary committee) bypassing the PAC (public accounts committee), the appropriate forum for scrutinising the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) report which would definitely deal with the pricing of the fighter jets.The unabashed efforts at politicising defence acquisitions like Rafale by questioning the integrity of the process without adequate evidence is rather unprecedented. This is bound to have serious repercussions on defence acquisitions in the future. We had seen the Bofors scam in the eighties which was raked up following the detection of a money trail linked to middlemen, but in the Rafale controversy there is no such link whatsoever and is based entirely on perceptions. Thanks to the paralysis in decisionmaking which followed the Bofors scandal, it was nearly 30 years before the acquisition of another set of guns of similar capability as the M777 Ultra Light Howitzers could be finalised.Defence acquisitions by their very nature are highly technical and procedure-bound. As a rule, speed is sacrificed at the altar of procedural puritanism. Our experience so far is that any major acquisition which should theoretically take a couple of years as per the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) takes anything from seven to eight years on average to materialise. The main factors contributing to the delay are the elaborate, but often contested, field trials, the evaluation of bids and the protracted negotiation processes. Add to this the unscheduled delays caused when rival bidders question some stage of decision-making with a view to discrediting their competitors in the fray.In short, a heavy price is paid in terms of time and money to preserve the integrity of the process. Even a mild deviation to facilitate quick decision-making is resisted by the acquisition bureaucracy, which might prefer to retract the entire process at the end of seven or eight years rather than take the risk of carrying the process through. A classic example was the go slow of the proposed indigenous development and manufacture of futuristic infantry combat vehicles nearly ten years after initiating the process.Needless to say, retraction of acquisitions at the fag end of the process is a terribly frustrating experience for the military leadership whose longterm acquisition plans for capability building get derailed. The armed forces rightfully feel badly let down. This is often one of the reasons that affect cordial civil-military relationship. This state of affairs exists because the acquisition bureaucracy is deeply (and rightly) apprehensive of the prospect of ex-post scrutiny by the “three Cs”, namely the CAG, the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) and the CVC (Central Vigilance Commission) some day in the future and possible departmental action or criminal prosecution. The stringent provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 had contributed a great deal to this state of affairs, but after its recent amendment things are expected to improve. Yet, this could still remain wishful thinking.In the aforesaid context, the political bickering over the Rafale acquisition based on mere perceptions is bound to worsen matters seriously by slowing further defence acquisitions. Officials will dither and procrastinate more than ever. They will record in notes that serve to save their skin but will be difficult for superiors to overrule. Senior decision-makers may riddle files with queries galore – both relevant and irrelevant – so that they can avoid making decisions during their tenure. The instinct of selfpreservation will blind officers to the exigencies of national security on an unprecedented scale. Another undesirable consequence could be extrareadiness to source equipment from public sector agencies, in complete disregard of their ability to deliver, by excluding the private sector. This will be an unwelcome prospect considering the headway India has to make in building private sector capabilities in defence production and R&D (research and development). Whether politicians of the socialist hue like it or not, it needs to be recognised that without the active involvement of the private sector through the creation of a defence industrial ecosystem in the SME (small and medium enterprises) sector, India is bound to lag behind in high-end technology development and innovation. Overplaying ‘crony capitalism’ will have deleterious consequences. Despite some bad examples in the corporate world, stigmatising capitalists and corporates will only lead to extreme hesitation in entrusting key defence acquisitions to the private sector. The unseemly debate on the Rafale offsets conveniently disregards the fact that offsets are the means of creating a vibrant defence industrial ecosystem in the private sector which is a sine qua non for a vibrant world-class defence industry. This is vital for the country to achieve its military goals of the future. The Ministry of Defence has also framed the strategic partnership policy for involving the private sector directly in the manufacture of major platforms such as fighter aircraft, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles or tanks. This is calculated to unleash the entrepreneurial and innovative energy of the private sector to develop a strong defence industrial base, which is undoubtedly the hallmark of a world military power. If in the aftermath of Rafale politics, the private sector becomes untouchable, the strategic partnership policy could be in serious jeopardy and this will help only the foreign vendors who are against India attaining self-reliance in defence manufacturing. The preamble of the DPP-2016 recognises that defence acquisitions are not a standard open market commercial form of procurement and has certain unique features such as supplier constraints and technological complexity and recognises that decisionmaking is unique and complex. The needs of the armed forces being nonnegotiable, flexibility in procurement process is required.The letter and spirit of the preamble have not yet led to the evolution of a new pathway for bolder and faster decision-making. Both probity and trust are essential. Bona fide decisions made transparently in the larger interests of national security have to be supported and a high margin of safety and protection afforded to the acquisition teams. A system of pre-audit by a team comprising representatives of the CAG and CVC and independent experts of proven integrity before signing any major contract could be a way out and this needs consideration of the government.It is therefore imperative that we isolate defence and national security issues from the rough and tumble of political games. They are not matters which are to be discussed openly in the streets or subjected to the glare and searing heat of media debates. It hurts the nation and demoralises the armed forces. The costs may be too high for the nation to bear. It should be the government’s endeavour to evolve a judicious system of discreetly examining defence and national security matters should there arise strong reasons to reopen any issue on solid evidence and not based on superficial perceptions. In a maturing democracy like ours it is high time the nation evolved a consensus on a code of conduct on responsible politics.(The author was the defence secretary of India from May 2015 to May 2017 when the deal for 36 Rafale jets was signed with France)","Jan 03, 2019, 09:15 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/view-rafale-critics-glossed-over-urgency-to-acquire-aircraft/articleshow/67358950.cms

Stranded cattle along Bangladesh border new headache for BSF,"There are around 1,000 seized bovines stranded at the border outposts in four sectors in West Bengal – Kolkata, Krishnagar, Berhampur and Malda – at any given point of time, said BSF officials.","Stranded cattle along the India-Bangladesh border are fast becoming a headache for the Border Security Force (BSF). The problem began with the customs department deciding to stop auctions of seized cattle in the past one month, following an order of the Supreme Court. Now the BSF, whose priority is to stop smuggling and seize cattle, has no place or wherewithal to dispose the seized animals.There are around 1,000 seized bovines stranded at the border outposts in four sectors in West Bengal – Kolkata, Krishnagar, Berhampur and Malda – at any given point of time, said BSF officials. Meanwhile, a dozen cattle died at the border outposts in the past week. The situation is the same in Guwahati sector, said a senior BSF official, who did not wish to be identified. According to an official estimate of the BSF, at least 800 cattle are stranded at five-six border outposts in southern Bengal. The number rose to 1,500 in December and it was highly challenging for the border guarding force to take care of the cattle, said officials. BSF managed to distribute some of the cattle among local cow shelters and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as villagers refused to accept these cattle. In December, the BSF distributed 2,000 cattle among local NGOs, they said.In a letter, dated November 1, to all zonal heads of customs in the eastern and north eastern region, customs commissioner (risk identification and intelligence) wrote, “The Supreme Court, in its order in August 2017 directed that the sale of cattle would be made in consonance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals rules, 2017. Customs officers are, however, not empowered under the provisions of the PCA rules or the PCA act. The PCA rules pertain to seizure of cattle under the provisions of PCA Act, whereas cattle are seized by customs or BSF under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962. Under the PCA Act, the state police officers are empowered to make seizure and hence compliance of provisions of the PCA rules for sale can only be done by state police officers.”The zonal heads of customs were directed not to take over cattle seized by the BSF and to request the force to hand it over to the state police.However, the state police reportedly refused to accept the cattle. “We have held several meetings with the state police. They have clearly said that they cannot accept cattle without the smugglers. They need to lodge a case before they take cattle in their custody,” said the senior BSF official cited earlier.","Jan 03, 2019, 09:32 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/stranded-cattle-along-bangladesh-border-new-headache-for-bsf/articleshow/67359663.cms
"After Amazon & Flipkart, now Swiggy, Zomato face the ire of small businesses","500 small to mid-sized restaurants sign online petition addressed to CCI and PMO; accusations include use of deep discounting, in-house kitchens and internal sourcing.","NEW DELHI: About 500 small to midsized restaurant companies alleged “misuse of dominant position by food delivery companies including Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats and Food Panda,” signing an online petition addressed to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to this effect.The accusations include the use of deep discounting, in-house kitchens and internal sourcing. “The companies have been continuously found to misuse their dominant position with the aim to wipe out small and medium enterprises,” said the petition, which ET has seen.Zomato and Swiggy denied the accusations. Uber Eats and Food-Panda didn’t respond to queries.“Unlike retail, FDI (foreign direct investment) restrictions are not applied on the restaurant sector or food service aggregators,” said Rahul Singh, president of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), which represents over 5,000 brands. “Predatory practices will be examined by the CCI. As an association, we have a roundtable discussion next week with all four major food delivery aggregators to address deep discounting and the cloud kitchen issue which is adversely affecting the restaurant industry.” Singh is the promoter of The Beer Café, which runs 40 outlets.The petition called on the CCI to “put an end to unsustainable pricing by these companies, prohibition of crossholdings of food services, delivery company to own or have a stake in any kitchen/restaurant, and appointing food regulators to ensure that a level playing field in not breached in the garb of cutthroat competition.”Anurag Katriar, chief executive of deGustibus Hospitality, which runs restaurant brands Indigo, Tote on the Turf and Neem, said the sector is getting hit.“Deep discounting by online food delivery platforms is impacting footfalls and diverting consumer traffic to these platforms,” he said. “Besides, the cost of doing business is escalating because commissions are directly getting impacted. These are hurting us in the long run.”Such offers are meant to be incentives and are voluntary, said Zomato. “Discounts are merely a mechanism to encourage user participation and all our restaurant partners can choose to participate in a discounting campaign,” a Zomato spokesperson said.The petition said Swiggy had started its own in-house kitchen, The Bowl Company, to “monopolise the market.”“They (Swiggy) are unethically diverting customers to their own kitchen,” the petition said. “A client is required to pay huge tariffs to get their products listed on the platform; however, the first ad which is shown to an end-user on logging in is Swiggy’s in-house kitchen – The Bowl Company.” The petition said this amounts to “misusing the customer database.”Swiggy denied that it sought to push users in any particular direction. “We do not practice diversion of traffic to any brand unethically,” a spokesperson said.“We doubled the number of restaurant partners on the platform to over 55,000. The commissions we charge are a function of the value we generate for our partner and are mutually agreed upon.”The Bowl Company was established to fulfil a gap in the market. “With private brands, we aim to meet unmet consumer needs,” the Swiggy spokesperson said. “Single-use ordering was a gap in the market and hence we created The Bowl Company.” She said the listing of the brand is ""similar to any other brand on the platform, and that it has led to numerous partners following the trend.""The restauranteurs said Zomato had set up in-house company HyperPure, which sells vegetables, chicken and other meat. They alleged that it forces restaurants who want to list on the Zomato platform to purchase these items from Hyperpure, which is against the Competition Act.Zomato denied this and said its aim was to provide fresh produce to restaurants.  “HyperPure is helping restaurants save efforts of sourcing food ingredients from an otherwise unorganised market,” the Zomato spokesperson said. We don’t constrain the restaurants on our platform to associate with HyperPure, doing so will be completely against our ethics.”Thomas Fenn, founder of specialty restaurant Mahabelly, said: “We need to reach a middle ground on commissions and have more transparency in the system. The delivery platforms are very good for the restaurant sector but the consequence cannot be detrimental for business. As for the… in-house kitchens, it is a clear case of conflict of interest.”Uber Eats is also offering unsustainable discounts on some menu items, the petition said. “The idea behind these organisations bringing in large war chest of funding by their foreign contributors is to close down small and medium-size restaurants. We favour foreign investments as long as it leads to innovation and growth in their respective sectors,” it said.On the in-house kitchen issue, Bengaluru-based restaurant Art of Delight founder Ayaaz Hameed, said: “The concept is fine for us as long as the cuisine they (the in-house kitchens) offer are not directly competing with us.”","Jan 03, 2019, 11:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/small-eateries-say-food-delivery-companies-misusing-dominant-position/articleshow/67359653.cms

"Sensex slips 100 points on weak global sentiment; Nifty50 tests 10,750",The US stock futures fell on Thursday after a rare revenue warning from Apple.,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks opened Thursday's session in the negative zone, tracking weak global sentiment after US stock futures fell and most Asian markets traded lacklustre.The US stock futures fell on Thursday after a rare revenue warning from Apple added to worries about slowing global growth, Reuters reported.A fall in the rupee even as crude oil prices declined further in global markets too impacted the mood. The Indian currency opened 11 paise down at 70.29 against the greenback amid buying in American currency by banks and importers.The softer manufacturing PMI also played its role in aggravating the selling in sectors.

What happens to PF balance after you quit your job,A PF account becomes inoperative if the employee does not make an application for withdrawal within 36 months of retiring after attaining the age of 55 years.,"Several employees on leaving one organisation and moving on to another for employment often forget or delay the transfer of the accumulated provident fund (PF) balance. Some of them consider withdrawing the PF balance of the previous company at a later date while some are satisfied as the balance keeps earning an interest rate even when there is no further contribution into that account. When does PF account become inoperative?Earlier, in case there was no contribution made for 36 months, then that account was classified as an 'inoperative' account. As per the existing rules (notified in 2016) , a PF account becomes inoperative if the employee does not make an application for withdrawal of accumulated balance in the PF account within 36 months of retiring after attaining the age of 55 years. Therefore, even after leaving one company, the PF account continues to earn interest and is not termed inoperative PF account till such a situation rises till age 55. However, during the period when contributions don't get credited to the PF account, the interest rate earned does not remain tax-free. According to a Bengaluru bench of the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) ruling, the interest credited to an Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) account after an individual ceases to be in employment is taxable in his hands in the year of credit.The 7-year ruleHowever, once the account becomes inoperative, the unclaimed funds are moved into the ""Senior Citizens Welfare Fund"". According to the rules, the unclaimed amount of the account which remains inoperative for 7 years is to be transferred to the Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund. Even the trusts of establishments exempted under Section 17 of the EPF & MP Act, 1952 also comes under the ambit of the Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund Rules and are required to transfer the requisite amount as required under these Rules to the Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund. The rules mandate that the unclaimed amounts that is to be transferred is to be identified on an annual basis by September 30 of each financial year and transfer to be made into the Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund on or before the 1st day of March every year. The 25-year ruleOnce the unclaimed balance gets transferred to the Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund, it remains there for 25 years. The rules, however, allow the members claiming to be entitled to the unclaimed amount transferred to the Fund to apply within 25 years from the date of credit of the unclaimed amount into the Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund. ""Thereafter unclaimed amount shall escheat to the Central Government unless a court orders otherwise,"" states the rules. In view of the large time span of 25 years, all exempted establishments should keep accounts and full employee wise details of each member whose amount is transferred to Senior Citizens' Welfare Fund including PF account number, Pension Account Number, name and father's/spouse's name of the employee, amount transferred, date of birth, date of joining, last known address of employee along with bank account number, Aaadhar card number, nominee details, list of family members etc. (wherever available).Leaving the balance with the old employer may not help much if withdrawing it at a later date is the plan as the interest earned during non-employment period gets taxed in the year of withdrawals. And, if you have retired at the age of 55, do not let it become inoperative and withdraw the final balance as early as possible. PF accounts cannot turn inoperative till age 55, yet transferring the PF balance from previous organisations to the current employer is always a better approach to aim for a sizeable corpus for your retirement.","Jan 03, 2019, 09:40 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/what-happens-to-your-pf-balance-after-your-leaving-job/articleshow/67349936.cms
"Bond market sending message of a real fear of the economy slowing down: Peter Cardillo, Spartan Capital","
If trade war is not settled in next 2-3 months, we could be looking at recession in 2020, says Cardillo.","Earnings are expected to be lower but perhaps in the second and third quarter, we had a real slowdown in      earnings, Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist, Spartan Capital Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: The first trading day of 2019 did not play out too well for the European markets or the Wall Street. Volatility seems to be a dominant factor even in 2019! We are going to have volatility going forward for a bit longer. The fear factors of trade war are continuing to increase and on the first trading day in New York, we saw swings. The gyrations continue to increase and the reason for that is because the market is still very much unsettled. The bond market continues to send the message to the markets that there is a real fear of the economy slowing down.  Obviously, we got some negative news out of China and going forward, we are probably going to see the States continue to weaken a bit. I am not quite sure whether we could be headed for a recession any time soon but if the trade war is not settled within the next two or three months, there is a near certain possibility that we are looking at recession in 2020 and that is what the bond market is basically flashing.  So what could we do right to get the growth fears stabilised? One of the factors would be that there is a resolution on the trade front but what other things could go right for the markets to stabilise and the volatility to reduce? The most important thing would be if we get a trade agreement between the United States and China. If that happens, then the economy will not be pressured towards recession and then we could continue to grow somewhere between 2.5% and 3% and obviously you would have a reversal in the bond market as well.  It is all predicated on the trade talks and the president of United States today in his press conference basically said that the trade war has basically been responsible for the market selloff in December and that the prospects of some sort of a trade deal is probably looking better now than before. That could be the key. Hopefully, we will get some sort of an agreement and that should reverse psychology and you could see a good rally develop during the course of the year. If you look at Wall Street, the stocks have been correcting a fair bit. Of course, there are massive economic concerns in the US. PMI data concerns in China yesterday, impacted the market sentiment in a big way. How real are these growth concerns?  Concerns are reflecting in investors’ confidence which has lost a great amount of percentage of points over the past quarter. Earnings are expected to be lower but perhaps in the second and third quarter, we had a real slowdown in earnings. That is another concern with some corporations already giving indications of softness. In fact, Apple came out and said that sales in China were very weak and as a result of that the stock was being pressured in the aftermarkets and obviously we are going to feel that pinch on Apple. But do you see other companies also following suit now that Apple has cut its revenue guidance for the first time in two decades, wilting under pressure from trade war?   I think there will be more companies. Obviously the trade war has increased the prices for many companies and they will be pressured and they will show up during the earning season.","Jan 03, 2019, 09:43 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/bond-market-sending-message-of-a-real-fear-of-the-economy-slowing-down-peter-cardillo-spartan-capital/articleshow/67359770.cms
India to brand its cashew better as exports fall,"Industry is planning a branding exercise to revive the sector’s lost dominance in the US.
","KOCHI: As the country’s cashew export heads for one of the worst falls in recent times, the industry is planning a branding exercise to promote Indian cashew.The data of Cashew Export Promotion Council of India (CEPCI) shows about 32 per cent decline in shipments in the six months to September in 2018-19 from a year ago at 30,805 tonnes. The revenue is also down by 32 per cent at Rs 2,135 crore for the period despite a marginal increase in unit value.Indian cashew has lost its dominance in the US, hitherto its biggest market, to Vietnam, which has been able to increase its share by selling at lower prices. “Vietnam now accounts for 76 per cent of the cashew imports to the US, where India was the major supplier,’’ said RK Bhoodes, chairman of CEPCI.Vietnam cuts cost by employing extensive mechanisation. “Vietnam sells 20 cents per pound less than Indian rates. But in terms of quality, the Indian nuts are superior,’’ Bhoodes explained.The cashew industry is planning to promote Indian brand of cashew at premium level to revive Indian cashew’s earlier glory in the US market. “We are looking at emotional connect in marketing with tags like ‘If you buy Indian cashew you will support 1 million workers’,’’ he said.CEPCI will place this suggestion at the global cashew summit in India to be held in February along with other demands such as financial support for the industry as rising cost of production has forced closure of many processing factories in Kerala and measures to control dumping of imported cashew kernels in the Indian market which is currently the largest consumer of cashew. The export prospect in the second half of the year is not promising as the cashew kernel prices in the global market remain low.","Jan 03, 2019, 09:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/india-to-brand-its-cashew-better-as-exports-fall/articleshow/67359739.cms
Index investing takes total AUM of ETFs to Rs 1 Lakh Crore,Financial experts recommend index funds or ETFs to investors because actively managed large-cap funds have failed to beat their benchmarks,"The assets under management (AUM) of passively managed funds have crossed the ₹1 lakh crore mark. While most of the funds continue to come from the mandatory contribution to the Employee Provident Funds Organisation (EPFO), financial planners point out that an increasing number of HNIs and retail investors have started pouring money into index funds and ETFs as actively managed funds in the large-cap space have failed to outperform their benchmarks.As per data from Accord Fintech, only 2 out of 32 large-cap funds could outperform their benchmark indices over the last one year. Given this, many financial planners have started recommending index funds or exchange traded funds as a substitute to large cap funds, and this shift is likely to accelerate in the coming days.“Index funds in India have a good demonstrated track record. There is no style risk and the cost is low,” said Rohit Shah, founder, Getting You Rich. Shah recommends index funds as a substitute to large cap funds. He believes indexing makes financial life uncomplicated for investors and they no longer have to bother about fund style or a fund manager leaving.Financial planners point out that the big push to passive investing has come after the SEBI norm on categorisation and rationalisation of mutual fund schemes. After this, large cap stocks are mandated to hold 80% of their portfolio in top 100 stocks by market capitalisation, prompting investors to look at passive funds.“Large cap funds had exposure to mid and small cap stocks and such funds were compared with Nifty and they were able to generate alpha. After the SEBI categorisation, it is difficult for large cap funds to generate alpha, on a consistent basis, due to which investors are going to passive funds,” said the product head at a domestic asset manager.Fund houses have also been steadily building their product bouquet in the passive space over the last couple of years. DSP has launched a Nifty Equal 50 fund, while the Aditya Birla fund house has launched a Nifty next 50 ETF. UTI has launched the UTI Nifty Next 50 Index Fund. SBI MF has launched a smart-beta ETF, a hybrid between traditional passive and active strategies.Even among sectoral indices, investors can access themes such as consumption, infrastructure, private banks, or PSU banks through ETFs, giving them a wide choice in the passive space.“Alphas are set to diminish. Add to that the overall cost-reduction stance of the regulator, making it natural for investors to start thinking of passive funds as an alternative,” said Swarup Mohanty, CEO, Mirae Asset Mutual Fund.Mohanty does not see any major changes in the near term from the actual flow from retail investors into passive funds, but asset managers are expected to expand their passive funds business.Gaining WeightFund nameInception date AUM (in Rs crore)SBI-ETF Nifty 5022 July, 201541,812SBI-ETF Sensex15 March, 201313,398UTI-Nifty ETF1 September, 2015 9,927Bharat 22 ETF 1 November, 20175,191Kotak Banking ETF4 December, 20145,075","Jan 03, 2019, 10:01 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/index-investing-takes-total-aum-of-etfs-to-rs-1-lakh-crore/articleshow/67360847.cms
Departures out of Delhi airport resume at about 9:30 AM; delays to continue,"While departures were halted, arrivals continued at Delhi airport the period saw 10 diversions during the period, primarily, due to pilot be non-compliant in low visibility landing procedures.","About 200 flights were delayed, as departures from Delhi airport was shut for about two hours in the morning till 9:30 AM leading to delays across the network and causing huge passenger inconvenience.While departures were halted, arrivals continued at Delhi airport the period saw 10 diversions during the period, primarily, due to pilot be non-compliant in low visibility landing procedures.A minimum visibility of 125 metres is needed for safe flight operations. Arrivals, however, require minimum visibility needed for them is 50 metres at Delhi airport, which has India’s most efficient instrument landing system. Predictions are that the visibility will likely be low tomorrow also.Fog impacted the operations at Delhi airport throughout the day, thus, causing passenger inconvenience.“CAT3 etc notwithstanding, stuck in d aircraft for last 3 Hrs at Delhi airport with absolutely no info. ATC too unable to tell when d flight wl get clearance. Fog in Delhi can cripple air movement at 12 noon. No technology can conquer nature,” BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav tweeted on Thursday.Airlines, ET got in touch with, confirmed that the standard operating procedures leads to a lot of complaints from passengers.“We do not board passengers till there is no hope for departures. Flights are boarded in batches depending on their timings. But the problems arise, when these flights get delayed even after boarding,” added an airline executive, who did not want to be identified.“Once boarded, there is still no easy way to get passengers off the aircraft if delay continues, as they have to clear security etc again. A requirement that is superfluous. So today too after boarding, passengers held for hours on board,” the official added.He further said that the rules here are unlike the west, where the departures level, aerobridge, and aircraft are all considered one secure zone. “Therefore, no issue for any passenger to come straight back into the departure area without clearing security,” he added.Another airline source added that today also a lot of flights were delayed because they had to return to refuel after waiting for hours to depart.“Today, some flights got hugely delayed as they were given pushback clearance and were waiting on line for take-off, but the wait was so long they had to come back to refuel. Took an hour or more to just come back to the gate, as gates and parking bays fill up in the meantime with arriving flights. Then they have to queue up all over again,” said the executive on a condition of anonymity.He added that allowing passengers to get off directly without going through all this additional security would help ease the pain.","Jan 03, 2019, 07:05 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/low-visibility-at-delhi-airport-affect-flight-operations/articleshow/67359872.cms

"Donald Trump wants India, Russia, Pakistan to fight Taliban in Afghanistan","In his first Cabinet meeting of the year, the US President also reffered to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for funding a library in Aghanistan, wondering who would use it in that country.","Expressing dissatisfaction over New Delhi's decades-old role in the Afghanistan peace process, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he wants the regional countries, including India, Russia and Pakistan to fight the Taliban in the war-torn country.  In his first Cabinet meeting of the year, the US President also reffered to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for funding a library in Aghanistan, wondering who would use it in that country.  ""Why is not Russia there (in Afghanistan, fighting the Taliban)? Why isn't India there? Why isn't Pakistan there? Why are we (US) there? We are 6,000 miles away. But I don't mind. We want to help our people. We want to help other nations,"" Trump told reporters in response to a question during the Cabinet meeting.  The US President cited India's efforts towards peace and development in Afghanistan but alleged that the countries were not doing enough in the war-ravaged country and that they were taking advantage of the United States.  Asserting that the Afghan war costs billions of dollars to the US, Trump said, ""I want people to treat us fairly"". He noted that heads of countries have told him that they are involved in the peace process by ""just sending some 100 or 200 soldiers"".  The US President referred to his friendly terms with Prime Minister Modi, but appeared critical of a library funded by India in Afghanistan.  ""I could give you an example where I get along very well with India and Prime Minister Modi. But he is constantly telling me, he built a library in Afghanistan. Library! That's like five hours of what we spend (in Afghanistan),"" Trump told his cabinet colleagues.  ""And he (Modi) tells me. He is very smart. We are supposed to say, oh thank you for the library. Don't know who's using it (the library) in Afghanistan. But it's one of those things. I don't like being taken advantage of,"" he said.  Trump drew a comparison between the expenses being borne by the US and other countries in the Afghan peace efforts.  ""What other countries have done for the last long period of time is given us some soldiers and then talk about it like it's the end of the world. And we are subsidizing their military is by billions and billions and billions of dollars, many, many, many times, what those soldiers cost that country,"" the US President said.  Responding to a question, he said he wants India to be involved in Afghanistan.  Asked if India's role in Afghanistan was going to be security related, Trump said: ""We are going to be doing something that is right. We are talking to the Taliban. We are talking to a lot of different people.""  ""But here's the thing, because you mentioned India. India is there. Russia is there. Russia used to be Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia, because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan. Russia. So you tend to look at other countries. Pakistan is there. They should be fighting. But Russia should be fighting,"" he said.  ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there.

"Nokia 7.1 review: Scores on the HDR display, rear camera; price is still a deal-breaker",This is the first mid-range device from Nokia with Zeiss optics.,"Price: Rs 19,999Rating: ***1/2Specifications: 6.26-inch IPS LCD (19:9 aspect ratio, 1520 x 720 pixels), Snapdragon 632 octa core processor, 3/4GB RAM, 32/64GB storage (expandable, dedicated slot), dual SIM, 13MP f1.8 + 2MP dual rear camera, 8MP f2.0 front camera, 4G with VoLTE, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, rear fingerprint scanner, 4,000mAh, Android 8.1, 160 grams.Pros: Sleek design, bright display, lightweight with a large battery, great battery life, good day-to-day performance, excellent rear camera, loud audio output.Cons: Glossy finish is smudge magnet, steep price for Snapdragon 636, weak front camera low light performance, no dedicated microSD slot. The Nokia 7.1 was announced by HMD Global in October 2018 but the India launch was in December 2018. This midrange phone is amongst the first set of phones from Nokia with an HDR10 display and Zeiss camera optics.From the very first look, the Nokia 7.1 is a stunner. It has an aluminum frame and glass back which makes it look and feel like a flagship phone. Our review unit is the Midnight Blue: a dark blue back with silver accents around the frame. While we give the phone full points for the sleek and stylish design, the glass back also makes it prone to scratches and smudges. It’s always a shame to cover up a beautiful design with a thick cover. AgenciesNokia 7.1 (www.amazon.com) This is one of the few compact smartphones available at this price. It feels more compact because it has a 5.84-inch display with a 19:9 aspect ratio. It’s also one of the first phones with an HDR 10 compliant display. We loved the screen because of the vibrant colour, high contrast and sharpness. We did feel that the screen bezels could have been slimmer and that they should have added the option to hide the notch. That being said, the screen is a joy to use for videos, viewing photos and games.The hardware is where things start going awry. The phone is powered by an octa core Snapdragon 636 processor which is not bad at all — but you can get the same in phones that cost half as much. We did not see any issues with day-today performance but won’t recommend this phone if you are into gaming. Games like PUBG and Asphalt 9 will work with low graphics and you’ll see dropped frames often. Battery life was as expected — a day with basic use. If you’re a heavy user, you will run out of juice by early evening. The good thing is that the phone supports fast charging and a 12V fast charger is included in the box.Apart from the screen, the camera is one of the highlights. This is the first midrange device from Nokia with Zeiss optics. It has a 12MP f1.8 + 5MP f2.4 dual rear camera with dual pixel phase detection autofocus. Numbers aside, it actually delivers fantastic results. Photo have vivid colours with a good amount of detail in daylight as well as indoors. Lowlight images suffer from soft details, but we found them good enough for sharing on social media. The bokeh mode impressed us further with excellent edge detection and a good amount of background blur. It would have been great if the camera was optically stabilised - OIS would have given the Nokia 7.1 an edge over the competition and sort of justified the price in our opinion. Meanwhile, the front camera is nothing great. Most of the selfies had soft details. The front bokeh mode has good edge detection but it takes time to recognise a face and show you the bokeh effect. Foldable Phones, Notch-Free Display: Smartphone Tech To Watch Out For In 2019Autoplay1 of 7Three, Four & Five Rear CamerasWhile the Google Pixel 3 and iPhone XR continue to push the boundaries of a single smartphone camera, other companies have not stopped there. Dual cameras became a norm in 2018 and we’ve also seen them in sub Rs10k phones. Huawei was first with a triple camera smartphone (P20 Pro) and others followed suit. Samsung Galaxy A7, LG V40, Oppo R17 Pro and Huawei Mate 20 Pro were some of the phones with triple rear cameras. Samsung didn’t stop there and went on to launch a phone with quad cameras – the Samsung A9. For 2019, there are already rumours of a Nokia phone with five rear cameras and we expect more companies to follow the trend. You can expect all major brands to have phones with multiple cameras across price brackets. According to us, having multiple cameras only makes sense when you get good results and flexibility (wide, macro, tele lenses).(In Pic: Samsung Galaxy A7)​Ultra-Fast ChargingBattery technology simply hasn’t kept pace with smartphone development. One solution to this is to have phones with larger batteries but this also makes the device larger/heavier. The other logical solution is to make the batteries charge faster. OnePlus users have enjoyed the super-fast Dash Charge feature. A number of smartphones also come with Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3.0. In 2018, we saw devices go beyond and develop their own ultrafast charging technologies. Oppo showed everyone how it’s done with SuperVooc charging on the Find X and R17 Pro. Huawei Mate 20 Pro has Super Charge 2.0, OnePlus launched WarpCharge on the OnePlus 6T McLaren edition while the Asus ROG has QuickCharge 4.0 support. These phones are capable of charging phones from 0 to 50% in less than 30 minutes which is good for about a day of battery life. In 2019, this ultrafast charging tech should be available on more smartphones. (In Pic: ASUS ROG Phone)​Phones That Support 5G4G and VoLTE is commonplace now thanks to Jio’s cross country network (and their affordable data packages brought prices down for everyone). The DoT has announced that they expect to complete the process of 5G spectrum auction by August 2019 which means that there are chances we might see 5G rollout by end of 2019. While the network rollout is not clear at the moment, the hardware for 5G is already ready. Qualcomm has already announced that they have over 15 smartphone OEMs committed to 5G for 2019. A number of them including OnePlus, Oppo and Huawei have also announced 5G phones for 2019 (we’ll see the first wave of announcements at the Mobile World Congress 2019).Tech Going MainstreamWe see new smartphone features every few months – starting from CES in January to various events through the year. We are also likely to see more of Qi wireless charging, phones without 3.5mm port, IR assisted face unlock, glass backs on entry-level devices, smaller, teardrop shape notches. Here are some of the favourites that are expected to be a lot more visible in the coming year.(In Pic: The FlexPai from Royole)Notch-free DisplaysWhile we first saw the notch in 2017, 2018 was when it came to even at entry-level devices. It’s now so prevalent that more people seem to hate it rather than understand why it’s there. Thankfully, we also saw smartphone brands take a step ahead with allscreen designs (without any notch). Phones like Oppo Find X and Vivo NEX and still on sale but you do have to pay a premium for the design. For 2019 we expect the all-screen design to take center stage as display prices come down. By the end of 2019, we should see mid-range smartphones with all-screen designs.(In Pic: On the left is the Oppo Find X, and on the right is the Vivo NEX)    A few other features we liked on the Nokia 7.1: fast and accurate fingerprint scanner, loud audio from the speakers, WiFi ac support, Bluetooth 5.0 support and stock Android interface with guaranteed updates with the Android One program.As an overall package, the Nokia 7.1 has got a few things right and it fails to impress in some areas. The biggest problem is the price. At Rs 19,999, it goes up against phones like Poco F1 that has a flagship Snapdragon 845 processor, larger display, larger battery and great cameras. For Rs 17,990, you can get the Realme 2 Pro with Snapdragon 660, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage and a 6.3-inch display with a dewdrop notch. Finally, if you like stock Android, Mi A2 and Moto One Power are also better options than the 7.1.","Jan 03, 2019, 11:10 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/nokia-7-1-review-scores-on-the-hdr-display-rear-camera-price-is-still-a-deal-breaker/articleshow/67359835.cms
Govt decides to put urban rental policy on the back burner,"“The rental policy is unlikely to be formalised any time soon. The main reason is that it is very sensitive,” a senior government official told ET on condition of anonymity. ","The government has decided to put on ice the proposed national urban rental housing policy, after an informal group of ministers (GoM) concluded that the move to set right the lopsided rent market in cities may not go down well with the electorate ahead of the general election.“The rental policy is unlikely to be formalised any time soon. The main reason is that it is very sensitive,” a senior government official told ET on condition of anonymity. “It aims to set right tenant-landlord relationship, which is a very tricky aspect in cities. Even in our interactions with the state governments, we have sensed an unease and reluctance.”This comes even as the policy has been in the works since the Modi government assumed charge in 2014. The first draft was put out in public domain in October 2015 and sought to promote various types of public-private partnerships for promotion of rental housing in the country and making good the growing housing shortage as a result of increasing urbanisation.In the 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-17), the urban housing shortage was estimated to be 18.78 million.With the local laws framed in favour of tenants, there have been many cases of tenants, including in prime commercial complexes, paying paltry rents frozen decades ago, and the landlords have not been able to evict them.The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, for instance, lays a condition for evicting the tenant in Section 14 (1) (e) saying that “the premises let out for residential purposes are required by the landlord for occupation as a residence for himself or any other member of his family dependent on him… and the landlord has no other reasonably suitable residential accommodation”. The housing and urban poverty alleviation ministry, however, feels that if it moves to correct this, it could upset the people. “We need a stable political environment to set these issues right. The states also need to be on board,” said the official cited earlier.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:04 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/govt-decides-to-put-urban-rental-policy-on-the-back-burner/articleshow/67360785.cms
Cost reimbursement linked to export target,The global demand is very poor and prices are low at Rs 27-28 a kg.,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has said that it would not reimburse the carrying cost of the buffer stock of sugar if the mills did not export the target quantity set for each unit. New Delhi also barred the industry from selling more sugar than the monthly quantity allotted to them.“Provided further for the quarterly reimbursement of the buffer subsidy in respect of quarter-III (January-March 2019) and quarter-IV (April-June 2019), the sugar mill is required to fully comply (with) all the orders/directives issued… during the 2018-19 sugar season,” said the consumer and food ministry note dated December 31. Last year, the government created a buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugar with an aim to help industry liquidate cane arrears (to be paid to sugarcane farmers). The government was to pay the interest to mills for carrying the buffer stock. While traders were happy with the move, sugar millers said that given the domestic prices, it doesn’t make sense to export.“The global demand is very poor and prices are low at Rs 27-28 a kg; so, it is not possible to export. Further, domestic prices are at Rs 29.50/kg in Maharashtra and Rs 31/kg in UP, while the cost of production is at Rs 30 a kg,” said an industry analyst.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:04 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/cost-reimbursement-linked-to-export-target/articleshow/67359665.cms
RK Dhawan's I-T affidavits detail reasons why he moved into CPN’s house,"Dhawan, back in 1997, had revealed he was constrained to live ‘separately’ because he was ‘pressurised’ by the then Janata Party government to “depose against Mrs Gandhi and her family.”","New Delhi: Known for keeping secrets, the late RK Dhawan—famously known as “doorkeeper” to late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi—slipped once when confronted about the ownership of a plush bungalow in Golf Links revealing the circumstances that forced him to move to a house he did not own.The house is at the centre of a property dispute as the owner’s daughter has gone to court seeking possession of her property and presented as proof several affidavits RK Dhawan signed for the I-T department. Dhawan’s widow Achala Mohan stays in the house now.Dhawan, back in 1997, had revealed he was constrained to live ‘separately’ because he was ‘pressurised’ by the then Janata Party government to “depose against Mrs Gandhi and her family.”In an affidavit on August 28, 1997, the deceased Congress leader stated that “prior to defeat of Mrs Indira Gandhi’s government in 1997, I was staying with my parents and brother at Atul Grove Road, New Delhi. After Mrs Gandhi’s defeat, the then JP government started pressurising me to depose against Mrs Gandhi and her family.”“Since I did not succumb to their pressure, my victimization began and they started harassing my parents, brother etc. and went to the extent of instituting false cases, arresting my aged father, brother, apart from myself and my friends,” Dhawan said in his statement.Dhawan further said that when Gandhi learnt of the “atrocities” allegedly meted out to him and his family, she “mentioned the matter” to CPN Singh, the then Governor of Punjab who, writes Dhawan, “had close associatioin with the Nehru family for more than 50 years”.Dhawan wrote that Singh had suggested that in order to “save my parents and brother from the harassment” he should start living “separately and offered his house” at Golf Links, ground floor of which was “lying vacant.”Dhawan, who died in August last year, said the house was offered “without any rent or conditions for as long as I wished.” Clarifying that the house belonged to Jayashree Singh, CPN Singh’s daughter and that he had “no claim whatsoever with the house and shall not stay for a day if and when she so desires,” Dhawan stated in his affidavit.Claiming it to be Dhawan’s affidavit, Jayashree annexed the same in her suit filed in a local court. As first reported December 26 by ET, Singh has moved Court to seek possession of the house from Dhawan’s widow.Two more affidavits dated August 6, 2013 and January 23, 2017 have been placed on record. Even after his wedding to Achala Mohan in 2012, Dhawan in his affidavit filed in 2013 clarified that neither him “nor his wife, family members, near and dear have any right whatsoever nor any license right to stay as licensee” in the house. Describing Jayashree as “lawful owner” of the house, he added that the house be vacated “immediately on my demise.”In the 1997 affidavit, Dhawan underlined he had “no evidence” regarding the actual date of his shifting to the bungalow. The affidavit states that after Singh’s death, Jayashree- the incometax payer- continued with the “arrangement” because of her father’s wish.Dhawan’s widow Achala Mohan refused to offer any comment for this story.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:05 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/rk-dhawans-i-t-affidavits-detail-reasons-why-he-moved-into-cpns-house/articleshow/67359991.cms
How to tag goals to your mutual fund investments,Calculating and investing to reach that financial goals could be called goal based investing.,"Instead of starting a random SIP in a mutual fund, based on past returns or flavor of the year, financial planners now suggest investors tag their SIPs and investments to their long-term financial goals.What is goal-based investing?Every investors could have some life goals that he needs to reach in the short term or long term. Calculating and investing to reach that financial goals could be called goal based investing.For example, if you want to plan a foreign holiday with your family in 2020, which is 18 months away, it is a short-term goal. If you wish to plan for higher education for your child who is aged three years now, you have 15 years, and it is considered a long-term goal. If your age is 30 years and you retire when you are 60, you have 30 years, which is a long-term goal.What is the process of planning for goals?The first step is identifying the goal for which you wish to invest and the time you have to reach it. Once done, find the cost of the goal today. Add a reasonable amount of inflation to that, which will tell you the cost of the goal in the year you wish to accomplish that. Decide the asset class with your financial advisor that suits you, work backwards and calculate the amount you could save via SIP or lumpsum or a combination of both to reach the goal.How can you use mutual funds to meet the goals?With the help of a financial planner, identify funds based on your risk profile which can help you reach your goal. For example, if you plan for a foreign holiday 18 months from now, which will cost you ₹5 lakh, you could use debt funds to reach that goal. Since it is a near-term goal and the time is less than three years, typically investment advisors would suggest you to go for a combination of debt and arbitrage funds, which could yield you between 6% and 8%. Do your math, and decide whether you wish to opt for a lumpsum investment or want to stagger it. Do also keep the tax implications in mind, as debt investments redeemed in less than 3 years are liable for short-term capital-gains tax. Similarly, for your child’s higher education, which is more than 10 years away, you could invest in equity funds.

No more sun & sand: Bengalureans now put subzero holiday destinations high on their bucket list,"Travellers are opting to visit some of the world’s coldest destinations like Russia, Finland and Norway.","BENGALURU: Travel addicts want to chill, literally. Taking a detour from stereotypical beaches in India and overseas, many Bengalureans have been opting to pose as snow bunnies in subzero temperatures in some of the world’s coldest destinations like Russia, Finland and Norway since December. Travel industry executives have noted a good jump in this budget-friendly sector and say the itinerary goes beyond the usual skispots and igloos.Take the case of traveller Sanchit Malhotra, currently on the last leg of his cold winter holiday in London after covering Helsinki and Rovaniemi in Finland. He wanted to experience snowfall and panoramic winter scenery in minus-15 degree temperature.Of course, the Northern Lights, reindeer and husky rides and dining at a makeshift snow-hotel took Malhotra back to the enchanting storybooks of his childhood days. Getty ImagesNorthern Lights in Longyearbyen city, Norway Svalbard. “Subzero holiday destinations lead to some of the warmest memories,” says Malhotra, adding, “We were tired of the routine Bollywood locales for New Year. Living the unusual life in extreme climatic conditions was challenging yet magical. I will take the cruise to the North Pole next Christmas.”Moscow was the chosen winter weather getaway for businessman Aditya Kumar in December. He visited Moscow earlier in the year but wanted to see the city covered in sleet and snow.Kumar went sailing on a boat on the frozen Moscow River, walked on the city’s high streets and subways that showcased snow installations and festive decoration.“There is no ‘best time of the year’ to visit a country. The same place is so different in each season,” says Kumar, who now wishes to visit all major cities like New York and London in subzero weather. Getty ImagesGapstow Bridge at Central Park, Manhattan in New York City. Travel experts note that exploring a country in subzero temperature is the new addition to the bucket list of Bengalureans. Seema Jaising of Che Experiences & Travels says, “There is a 20% year-on-year growth in the White Christmas travel sector. Earlier, people booked routine South East Asia and the US. Now they want to see Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland in winter.” She adds that popular activities booked are reindeer rides, visiting Christmas markets, catching the Northern Lights, and visiting the busiest post office in the world in Santa Town (Finland).According to the trend report by travel platform Expedia, it is interestingly only cold countries — Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Latvia — that have emerged as the top five holiday destinations for 2019.Manmeet Ahluwalia, marketing head for Expedia in India, says, “The trend to experience extreme winters in cold locations increased by 25% this year. Travelling in winter to these locations is comparatively cheaper as it is off-season. The Christmas and New Year holidays also give people a reason to take a vacation.”India was not far from the radar. Many chose to spend White Christmas in domestic cold getaways. Travel booking platform Ixigo notes how travellers dropped traditional holiday spots like Goa for colder spots this winter. “There was a 34% jump in bookings to Srinagar and Leh from Bengaluru with an unusual 14% drop in bookings to Goa in December 2018. A small section of travellers also opted to visit international off-season destinations including Germany, New York, Edinburgh and Iceland for a snow-filled vacation,” says co-founder Aloke Bajpai. Wish To Travel The World? Don't Miss Out On These 7 DestinationsAutoplay1 of 8Travel The WorldBy Masoom GupteTo reduce the world to a list of top destinations is a near impossible task. But for a variety of reasons some places are favoured over others and become the flavour of the moment. Here are some of the top spots trending this year.The Five Stans Of Central AsiaTogether, the five Stans — Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan — of Central Asia spell exotic. The historical association with the Silk Road, that passes through these countries, adds to the appeal and aura of the region. From cities like Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva and Tashkent, that mix the new with the old seamlessly, to the topography of the region that abounds in vast deserts, mountains and rivers, this promises to be the journey of a lifetime.Europe (Iceland)When the landscape of Iceland showed up in a Bollywood movie some time back, many were prompted to ask if the sequence was shot on location, or if the backdrop was a result of computer generated graphics. That’s how unreal Iceland can be. The popularity of this European nation has been on a steady rise, prompting a national discussion about applying curbs on the number of tourists permitted to visit. Best to tick this one off the bucket list, before your name slips on to a waiting list of visitors.Africa (Rwanda)True, the country has a checkered past, enmeshed in a long history of violence. But nothing like tourism to change a nation’s image and fortunes. Earlier this year, the country’s tourism department signed a multi-million dollar branding deal with English football club Arsenal, putting the country’s tourism tagline on player jerseys. The deal quickly became controversial as Rwanda is one of the world’s poorest countries and marketing monies are frowned upon. But soon the number of UK visitors surged, claimed officials. Something did the trick. Either the campaign, or the country’s stunning national parks and wildlife.Antartica (The Ship Breaker Cruise)This one is for the adrenaline chasers. Go to the end of the world aboard a ship breaker, surrounded by glaciers and water, and little else. High fitness levels are recommended. But even that’s not a guard against potential sea sickness bouts. Prepare for wonder on this journey, and a discovery of what you are truly made of.

"GST rate cut to hike cost of low, mid-priced houses","Following the latest GST council meet, finance minister Arun Jaitely had announced that the proposal to reduce the rate may be taken up in the forthcoming meeting this month.","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 02, 2019)NAGPUR: Contrary to the perception that reduction of GST rate from the present 12% to 5% on under-construction homes would make houses cheaper, the move may, in fact, hit the interest of low and mid-priced home buyers. Reason: The input tax credit (ITC) is likely to be done away with if such properties are brought under the 5% composite tax slab of GST.Last week, following the latest GST council meet, finance minister Arun Jaitely had announced that the proposal to reduce the rate may be taken up in the forthcoming meeting this month.The segment to be affected would be buyers of homes costing up to Rs7,000 per square feet. Considering the current cost of construction, which more or less is standard, and the rate of tax applicable on the material, having 12% GST along with ITC makes a better deal rather than 5% on composite basis (without ITC).ITC is a rebate available to every taxpayer in a chain-based system like GST. The tax paid at the time of purchase of any input or raw material for making the end product is deducted from final liability.This prevents cascading effect. The anti-profiteering laws under GST regime call for passing on ITC benefit to consumers.Here is an example how 5% composite tax would have an impact on the gross rate of a property priced up to Rs7,000 a sq ft.Suppose a flat is priced at Rs5,000 per square feet. Along with 12% GST, the cost to builder comes to Rs5,600 per sq ft. Considering the current cost of material and tax applicable on it, the ITC comes to around Rs450 to Rs540 a square feet, say builders. The average cost of construction ranges from Rs2,500 to Rs3,000 a square feet, say builders. As majority of construction inputs attract 18%, ITC also comes to around Rs500.After passing on the ITC to consumer, the net rates for a Rs5,000 per square feet flat comes to Rs5,100. The net rate would be Rs5,600 if GST is at 12%. If the tax is reduced to 5% composite, the rate after adding up the tax component will come to Rs5,250. Thus, the cost of property is higher at 5% GST.Thus, up to a price of Rs7,000 per square feet, the buyer benefits under 12% regime with ITC. If the per square feet rates are higher, 5% is advantageous.This means only premium home buyers will benefit if the rates are reduced, while those going for affordable or moderately priced homes may have to shell out more.Realtors and tax advisers say it would also add to confusion for deals already sealed at 12%, where the properties are still under construction.There are many flats under construction for which deals have been struck and payments made or the process is underway. In such a scenario, the builder could end up charging additional money.Pritam Mahure, a chartered accountant, said a number of developers have passed on the anti-profiteering benefit to buyers. They are now worried about the future costing. Developers also say that it would take the tax regime backwards as even in service tax, which preceded GST, credit was available.Mahure also agreed that it would hamper long-term interest of mid-priced buyers. Rather than reducing the rate, the government should ensure compliance with anti-profiteering laws, which can be a long-term move, he said.Gaurav Agrawala, secretary of Nagpur unit of Confederation of Real Estate Developers of India (CREDAI), said abrupt change in rate can lead to disputes with buyers if builders charge them the additional amount. Builders have already passed on the benefit, but now they will have to bear the loss or else charge the customer.Anil Nair of Pioneer Group said builders who have already purchased construction material will not get the credit if the new rate is made applicable.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:07 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/real-estate/gst-rate-cut-to-hike-cost-of-low-mid-priced-houses/articleshow/67360046.cms

Work on livestock census stuck in UP,"A day after announcing the cess, the state government on Wednesday released Rs 18 crore for maintenance of 16,000 cows in the existing cow shelters in 16 urban centres in UP.","Uttar Pradesh has imposed a 0.5% cow welfare cess on excise and other departments saying the money raised will be used for building new cow shelters, but construction of cow shelters is stuck in 68 districts of the state since land acquisition has not been completed . Moreover, work on counting the number of cows in the state under the ongoing 20th Livestock Census is proceeding at an unsatisfactory pace, according to the Centre.A day after announcing the cess, the state government on Wednesday released Rs 18 crore for maintenance of 16,000 cows in the existing cow shelters in 16 urban centres in UP, earmarking grant of Rs 30 per day for each cow in these shelters. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday held a detailed review meeting on the stray cows issue and instructed all district magistrates to solve it by January 10 .The fresh measures came barely a fortnight after the state government on December 17 wrote a letter to all district magistrates in UP urging them to provide land acquisition orders. “Provide the status of availability of land for cow shelters at the earliest so that work can begin in public interest,” said the letter, a copy of which was seen by ET, written as a follow-up to a letter written on December 3 seeking the same information.The Centre had pulled up the state on December 7 in a video conference for the slow progress under the livestock census, after which the UP government in a letter to its officers on December 10 said it was “an example of gross negligence and apathy towards a national programme”.State officials said that conducting the livestock census has become a major challenge since many districts are struggling with the burgeoning problem of stray cattle let loose by farmers.In another letter sent on December 10 to the chief veterinary officers posted in all districts, the state government said the Centre had in an earlier meeting on December 7 expressed its “dissatisfaction” with UP’s speed of conducting the census. “It was directed earlier that the counting of livestock should begin in every district by December 1, ” the letter said.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:10 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/work-on-livestock-census-stuck-in-up/articleshow/67360097.cms
"Dena Bank valuation justified, Vijaya Bank should have got premium, not discount: Siddharth Purohit, SMC Global Securities","
“Dena Bank valued at a discount of 26.5% to Bank of Baroda and Vijaya Bank at close to 6% discount.”","The largest bank being Bank of Baroda, they have been taken as a base and calculation has been done for othe       r banks according to the valuations of Bank of Baroda, Siddharth Purohit, research analyst, SMC Global Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: What are you making of the swap ratio which has got announced? Would you say that the ratio is going to alleviate pricing concerns, given how heavily skewed it is in favour of BOB? In fact, for the shareholder Bank of Baroda it was a big hangover earlier that what could be the swap ratio basically and hence the stock had corrected post the announcement of the amalgamation. But the ratio has come as a relief for Bank of Baroda at least. Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank obviously has been valued at a discount.  Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Bank of Baroda Ltd  moved down by 1 in a month on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »According to my calculation, Dena Bank has been valued at a discount of close to 26.5% to Bank of Baroda and Vijaya Bank at close to 6% discount. For Dena Bank, it is quite justified, their asset quality being much weaker. They had a GNPA of close to 23.5% compared to Bank of Baroda’s 11.7%.  For Vijaya Bank, the valuations are a little lower but it is not that disproportionate. I do not see much negative reaction to that. Now indirectly, some time back, Dena Bank had been under PCA and probably the merged entity will have a better capital adequacy ratio compared to Dena Bank. But what will happen is that probably with the merger of Dena Bank, the capital adequacy of Bank of Baroda or the merged entity will also come down and along with asset quality deterioration to some extent.  So while for Bank of Baroda’s existing shareholders, it is positive, it all depends on how much money is to be given to the merged entity. That is the main question we should be talking right now. As of now, it comes as a relief for Bank of Baroda shareholders and all depends on how much money we should get and then accordingly, the merged entity will decide how to chuck out the growth plan for coming years. But more importantly, with merger probably there will be some more cleaning up to be done for Dena Bank books to align it with Bank of Baroda and with Vijaya Bank because Vijaya Bank also had a very good asset quality. Based on your back of the envelope calculations, there are quite a few numbers, the swap ratio indicates a loss of 27% approximately for Dena Bank, around 6% to 7% for Vijaya Bank. It, indicates that the swap ratio is tilted in favour of Bank of Baroda. Can you just walk us through what your calculations are throwing up?  Exactly that is what I said that my calculations also show that Dena Bank has been valued at 26.6% discount and Vijaya Bank at 5.9% discount to Bank of Baroda. So what you are saying is correct. I say that this is justified because in terms of asset quality, Dena Bank had much weaker assets. The net NPA was 11.7% whereas Bank of Baroda’s net NPA was 4.86%.  Certainly you cannot expect the same valuations like Bank of Baroda. Now even for capital adequacy, Bank of Baroda had a common equity of 9.05% whereas Dena Bank had close to 7.5%. The valuations that Dena Bank has got is more or less justified but probably before announcement or post the announcement of amalgamation, there was a lot of hope that they might get a favour and hence the stock had rallied a lot.  I believe that now there will be knee-jerk reaction in the Dena Bank stock accordingly. But for Vijaya Bank, with better balance sheet and capital adequacy, they should have got a better ratio. They should have got premium not discount. So it is a little bit of disappointment for Vijaya Bank because they had a much better asset quality and capital adequacy. But what is important is the largest bank being Bank of Baroda, they have been taken as a base and calculation has been done for other banks according to the valuations of Bank of Baroda.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:12 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/dena-bank-valuation-justified-vijaya-bank-should-have-got-premium-not-discount-siddharth-purohit-smc-global-securities/articleshow/67360053.cms
Congress' first family understands only ‘paisa’: Arun Jaitley,"Dismissing Gandhi’s allegations of irregularities in the Rafale deal, Jaitley said he “took unprecedented liberties with truth"".","New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley made a scathing attack on Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha during the Rafale jet deal debate, saying a family whose name cropped up in three scams has the audacity to question others even as he alleged that the Congress President does not know what a combat aircraft is.Speaking after Gandhi made direct charges against PM Narendra Modi in the Rafale deal, Jaitley said the head of a party that ruled India for 60 years was expected to know better. He reiterated that the Rafale jets have been bought by the NDA government at 9% less than the price negotiated by the UPA dispensation and the cost of the planes with all the gadgets is 20% less than that of the previous government.Jaitley said it is a tragedy that the nation’s “Grand Old Party is today headed by a gentleman who doesn’t even understand what a combat aircraft is”.He alleged that Congress is harping on “?500 (crore) versus ?1,600 (crore)” – the price of the Rafale planes during UPA and NDA regimes. “There is a reason for that. Some people and families in India only understand the arithmetic of money... They don’t understand national security but only paisa,” he said. He invoked a dialogue from Ian Fleming’s James Bond series while attacking the Nehru-Gandhi family for its alleged involvement in past scams.“If it was one case, I may have given the family the benefit of doubt. In Bofors, the finger points to you, in National Herald the finger points to you, in AgustaWestland the finger points to you. Three is a bit too much… Bond had said if it happens once, it’s happenstance; if it happens twice, it’s a coincidence; but if it happens thrice, then it’s a conspiracy… And today conspirators who have played with India’s national security have the audacity to raise questions on a defence deal,” Jaitley said. Targeting Gandhi, Jaitley said he would have played in the lap of ‘Q’, an apparent reference to Ottavio Quattrocchi—allegedly involved in the Bofors case.Dismissing Gandhi’s allegations of irregularities in the Rafale deal, Jaitley said he “took unprecedented liberties with truth"".","Jan 03, 2019, 10:14 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/congress-first-family-understands-only-paisa-arun-jaitley/articleshow/67360136.cms

Doval to meet Afghan NSA in Delhi tomorrow,"​​India is considering supplying additional military hardware to Afghanistan to help it combat terrorists, according to people aware of the matter.","NEW DELHI: National Security Advisers (NSAs) of India and Afghanistan will meet in Delhi on Friday to discuss the security situation in Afghanistan and explore ways to enhance security partnership including supply of military hardware as the United States plans to withdraw its troops. India is considering supplying additional military hardware to Afghanistan to help it combat terrorists, according to people aware of the matter. They said this issue would be discussed when AK Doval meets his Afghan counterpart, Hamdullah Mohib. While Afghan army officers undergo training in India on a regular basis, India had earlier also supplied Afghan armed forces with four Russian-made helicopters. Withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, even if it is a small fraction of the total troops, would create a political and military vacuum, said experts. They said that coupled with the Trump administration’s efforts of reconciliation with the Taliban, the emerging situation would work to India’s disadvantage. Pakistan Army’s back door entry in Kabul is a given if the Taliban return to power or in a power-sharing arrangement, they said. Last month, US President Donald Trump announced that he had directed to bring back half of the 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan, even as the 17-year-old war continues and the Taliban threaten large parts of the landlocked country. The US reconciliation efforts with the Taliban have coincided with China’s efforts to create a China-Pakistan-Afghanistan triangle to safeguard its interests and extend its Belt and Road Initiative to Afghanistan. India, while continuing to engage the US over Afghanistan, is exploring initiatives with Russia to safeguard its interests in Afghanistan. The Afghan situation was at the top of the agenda when Doval met his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, in Delhi last month. That meeting was followed by the visit of Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov. Earlier, Indian delegates were on the same table with the Taliban in the ‘Moscow format’ of talks, a Russian initiative on Afghanistan.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:21 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/doval-to-meet-afghan-nsa-in-delhi-tomorrow/articleshow/67360203.cms
"Apple cuts revenue forecast, citing weak China sales amid trade tensions",The news sent Apple shares tumbling in after-hours trade.,"  Apple on Wednesday took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast, with Chief Executive Tim Cook blaming slowing iPhone sales in China, whose economy has been dragged down by uncertainty around US-China trade relations. The news sent Apple shares tumbling in after-hours trade and triggered a broader selloff in the stock market. The revenue cut for the just-ended quarter raises questions about whether Apple, the face of American business in many parts of the world, is being punished by Chinese officials or consumers in favor of local rivals such as Huawei, whose pricey smart phones compete with the iPhone and which has been under discussion by the Trump administration for a possible sales ban over suggestions that its telecommunications equipment could be used to spy on Americans. Cook told CNBC that Apple products have not been targeted by the Chinese government, though some consumers may have elected not to buy an iPhone or other Apple device because it is an American company. ""The much larger issue is the slowing of the (Chinese) economy, and then the trade tension that has further pressured it,"" Cook said. Some analysts, however, questioned the impact of Apple's own actions, such as its unyielding pursuit of high selling prices for its products. Apple on Wednesday lowered its forecast to $84 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 29, below analysts' estimate of $91.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple originally forecast revenue of between $89 billion and $93 billion. ""While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,"" Cook said in a letter to investors. ""In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 per cent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad."" Wednesday was the first time that Apple issued a warning on its revenue guidance ahead of releasing quarterly results since the iPhone was launched in 2007. Apple shares skidded 7.7% in after-hours trade, dragging the company's market value below $700 billion. In the broader market, the S&P 500 futures fell 1.5%. In the US government bond market, a typical safe-haven, the yield on the benchmark 10- year, which moves inversely to the bond's price, sank to an 11-month low. Precursors to a warning Apple's move was not entirely a surprise. In November, the Cupertino, California-based company said it would quit disclosing unit sales data for iPhones and other hardware items, leading many analysts to worry that a drop in iPhone sales was coming. And after several component makers in November forecast weaker-than-expected sales, some market watchers called the peak for iPhones in several key markets. In November, Cook cited slowing growth in emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Russia for a lower-than-anticipated sales estimates for the company's fiscal first quarter. But Cook specifically said he ""would not put China in that category"" of countries with troubled growth. That all came before the damage to the Chinese economy from trade tensions with the United States and long-simmering structural issues became evident. Apple is now the highest-profile multinational corporation to warn that the economic slowdown in China could hurt its business. Automakers such as Ford Motor, Hyundai Motor and Nissan Motor all previously said they planned to cut production in the country. But Apple has held firm on its premium pricing strategy in China despite the risk of a slower economy. ""The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,"" James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, told Reuters. In the latest fiscal year, ended Sept. 29, unit sales of the iPhone were essentially flat from the prior year, while iPhone revenue expanded 18% to $166.7 billion. That growth came entirely from higher prices. Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Cook's comments on the impact of the US trade tensions with China ""might be a dig at (US President Donald) Trump, but mostly he may be using the trade turmoil as an excuse for some missteps they've made over the last year."" But some investors were heartened by Apple's plans on using its cash pile. In his letter, Cook said Apple has $130 billion in net cash and that it intends to continue its efforts to reduce that cash balance to net zero, which the company has so far accomplished through dividend increases and share buybacks. ""We would anticipate the company increasing share buybacks on the weakness to return capital to shareholders at discount prices,"" said Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners.

A darshan in secrecy: How cops planned pre-dawn Sabarimala trek,"While senior police officers on duty were briefed about the plan, they were also asked not to share details with other officers. ","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 03, 2019)THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: When chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan met reporters on Monday, he said the police had several limitations in a place of worship and that was why they had to abandon their efforts to escort the women till Sannidhanam.He also said that if any women wanted to visit Sabarimala, ignoring the protests, police would stand with them.A day later, on Tuesday night, the police translated to action the assurance of the chief minister, when the two women -- Bindu and Kanakadurga -- had insisted on visiting Sabarimala even after being warned about all consequences.""After the aborted bid on December 24, they were taken out of Pathanamthitta district but were under the watch of the police. They insisted that they wanted to go to Sabarimala, come what may, and also questioned why were the police not showing regards to the apex court order,"" a senior officer in the know said. For the past eight days, they had been living in undisclosed destinations and hadn't even contacted their families. There was a complaint by Kanakadurga's relatives alleging that she had gone missing, to which she responded with a video message, saying that she was safe. Sources in police, however, said that the day chosen for the trek had nothing to do with Monday's Women's Wall.""The day was chosen when the attention was not towards the temple, and we had told them that they will be taken to the temple after 11pm and before 3.30am,"" the officer added.The police also made elaborate preparations by informing the chief minister and the state police chief about how they plan to take them to the temple. Once the nod from higher ups was received, the action started. The Travancore Devaswom Board president, members and officials were not informed about the plan.While senior police officers on duty were briefed about the plan, they were also asked not to share details with other officers. Another officer, who was aware of the plan, confirmed that both women were taken till Marakkoottam from Pamba in an ambulance and from there they climbed on foot to Sannidhanam. They were accompanied by six of their male friends and six plainclothes police personnel.They had darshan around 3.30am, accompanied by six police personnel in black plainclothes. The women avoided the traditional 'Pathinettam Padi' route and came discreetly through the staff entrance route, without 'irumudikkettu'. Though both of them carried 'irumudikettu' when they began the trek, it was upon the request of the police that they decided not to carry it to avoid any last-minute attention from devotees.The women also had dressed in black kurta-like attire with a black hood in the head with a shawl exposing only the face and had a quick darshan when the temple opened for 'nirmalyam'.Though the police did not confirm from where they began their journey on Tuesday and to where they shifted the women after darshan, sources said that they chose the late hours after 1am to begin their ascent from Pamba so as to minimise any risk of protesters. Both women took the trek route to return to Pamba.""We had informed the key personnel in the government, but had not informed anyone in the TDB,"" sources added. Police also said that all the district police chiefs were asked to be alert on Wednesday as the whole matter could lead to a tense situation. Police also said that the women would continue to be under police protection till the whole issue dies down and normalcy is retained.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:28 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/a-darshan-in-secrecy-how-cops-planned-pre-dawn-sabarimala-trek/articleshow/67360244.cms

"Why Bangladesh, a star in the developing world, looks pretty tarnished",Sheikh Hasina will have to begin by rebuilding the institutions that her administration has destroyed.,"by Mihir SharmaBangladesh under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina looks like a developing-world success story. Last year, its economy grew at close to eight percent a year, faster than its neighbor India’s. Its human development indicators, as Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen is fond of pointing out, are even better than its income level would indicate.Bangladesh is also one of the few countries in the developing world which has successfully wedded secularism to its national identity. And, in a truly extraordinary act that should shame many larger and richer countries, this enormously crowded nation — the most densely populated of all countries with a population greater than 10 million — has taken in at least 700,000 persecuted Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with a minimum of fuss or outrage.So, it's hardly surprising that Sheikh Hasina’s party won last week’s elections in Bangladesh. The scale of her victory, however, is literally unbelievable: Her Awami League won all but 10 of Bangladesh’s 298 constituencies. In her own seat of Gopalganj, the prime minister won by 229,539 votes to 123.No wonder her party has been accused of — to put it politely — “over-managing” the election. The polls were, after all, preceded by a long period in which political opponents were intimidated, jailed or exiled. The leader of the opposition Bangladesh National Party, Khaleda Zia, is in jail. Her son and heir apparent is in Britain and faces a life term if he returns to Bangladesh.While political violence has long been a feature of Bangladeshi politics — as in West Bengal, on the Indian side of the border —the past year has been particularly bloody. Worse, among the offenders have been the security forces, which seemed to have become an arm of Sheikh Hasina’s reelection campaign. The country has few remaining independent institutions that can serve as a check on this sort of blatant subversion of democracy. The judiciary in particular has been packed with Awami League sympathizers.The government has used a controversial new law to arrest journalists who have questioned the official narrative about the elections. Nevertheless, Facebook timelines have erupted with stories from Bangladeshis who were intimidated by Awami League men at voting centers, or from those who discovered that their votes had already been cast for them.Seen from India, the way the election has played out is hugely disappointing. For one, Bangladesh has long been held up here as something of a role model in terms of governance: a country that has, unlike India, developed a thriving export sector; a country that, in spite of being resource-poor, has managed to empower its people and especially its women; a country in which the government machinery has displayed a certain humility and pragmatism when it comes to trying and testing various grassroots development solutions.And Sheikh Hasina herself, with her uncompromising views on political Islamism and her commitment to the values of Bengali — and not Muslim — identity on which Bangladesh was built, is the kind of partner that India would like to have. Certainly, Khaleda Zia’s tenure in the 2000s is remembered in New Delhi with a shudder, as Bangladesh seemed set to take the turn towards radicalism that has blighted Pakistan’s fortunes, and become an exporter of terrorism to the neighborhood.But, the damage done by the government's electoral ""management"" goes far beyond the bilateral relationship with India. Few governments anywhere will celebrate Sheikh Hasina's reelection under these terms. An illiberal democracy is no less dangerous in the long term just because it happens to be run by a liberal.The simple truth is that Sheikh Hasina will not rule forever. Nobody can. And if her turn towards authoritarianism also tarnishes, in Bangladeshis’ minds, the Awami League’s principles of secular nationalism and inclusion, then the reaction will be awful indeed — and the implications for the stability of South and Southeast Asia will be even worse. Bangladesh’s prime minister should think of this five-year term as her last and begin to plan for what happens when she eventually turns over power to the opposition, as all democratic leaders must in time. She will have to begin by rebuilding the institutions that her administration has destroyed.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:34 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/why-bangladesh-a-star-in-the-developing-world-looks-pretty-tarnished/articleshow/67360268.cms

View Stock Analysis »Dalal Street’s only problem right now is volatility, which creates a risk that investors might get trapped in low quality stocks.Analysts, who expect a better but choppy year ahead for equities, say investors should consider growth stocks on any reasonable fall to make most of the post-election opportunities. “As we head into 2019, the Indian market is likely to remain volatile. We take a balanced approach to investing by being selective in taking risk (diversified equity exposure) while keeping a greater margin of safety and keeping some power dry for tactical opportunities through the year,’’ said Nitin Singh, MD & Head of Standard Chartered Wealth Management.On Monday, Sensex ended the calendar 2018 with 6 per cent gains. India no more overvaluedThe market cap-to-GDP ratio, largely known as Buffett indicator, now stands at 80 per cent against a long-term average of 78 per cent. This is much better than 113 per cent for US and 82 per cent for the rest of the world. With earnings improving in the next couple of quarters, this indicator may drop to 75 level, which may make domestic equities attractive.“Incorporating the growth prospects domestically, we seem to be well placed with India’s stock market cap quoting at 80 per cent on a trailing GDP basis, and 75 per cent on next year’s GDP assumptions. Hence, India is not overvalued and certainly well below the vulnerable mark i.e. 100 per cent,” ICICI Securities said in a note.The recent market correction from 2018 peak has created a greater valuation buffer, with valuations converging closer to longer-term averages, compared with the peak valuations a few months back, Standard Chartered said in a note.The three biggest worries for stocks i.e. shadow banking crisis, inflation and general elections, may not impact India’s macro drivers majorly in the long term, unless the situation worsens. Others What to do with rising volatility?After trading in the 10-20 range for most of 2018, India VIX saw a breakout last month after hitting a high of 22.82. The index now trades at 15.3 level.“It may start inching upward from the middle of February amid interim budget and at the time of general elections. A breakout above 24 would set a target of 40 level,” said Reliance Securities.What would be the best strategy? Traders can hedge portfolios by adopting a bear spread of 10,500/9,500 for long-dated options of June 2019 expiry, by paying a premium of Rs 240 for the said strikes, Reliance Securities said.For long-term investors, quality and growth would continue to command premium valuations. Keep nibbling at quality stocks and use price corrections to add fundamentally strong stocks, Sharekhan said. “The biggest change could be the continued narrowing of valuation gap between corporate-focused lenders and retail-focused banks in the private banking space. Certain pockets within the midcap space are likely to see renewed investor interest as earnings remain strong, whereas valuations have turned more reasonable now. We retain our overweight position on IT services, consumer discretionary, industrials and insurance companies. We are neutral or cautious on mid-tier PSU banks, energy, pharma and metals segments,” the brokerage said.Neeraj Dewan, Director at Quantum Securities, said he would be positive on capital goods stocks. “I will be positive on PSU banks and auto stocks where we have seen some correction. Some consumption slowdown happened recently, but I think that is a temporary phenomenon, which should tide over now. So, these are the sectors I would be looking at,' he told ETNOW.Brokerage JM Financial prefers largecaps over midcaps, and believes largecap IT, bank, industrials and non-bank PSUs are in the ‘buy zones’ now.“Our main recommendations for 2019 are: overweight private financials, industrials and PSU names. Within midcaps, we are overweight on real estate and chemicals, and neutral (from underweight) on IT after the recent correction,” the brokerage said.

Another Cheteshwar Pujara master-class gives India day 1 honours at SCG,"At stumps, Pujara (130) and Hanuma Vihari (39) were holding fort for the visiting side, which is in pursuit of a maiden Test series triumph on Australian soil.","SYDNEY: Cheteshwar Pujara played the anchor's role yet again with his third masterful hundred of the series, helping India dominate Australia on the opening day of the fourth and final Test here.Leading 2-1 after the 137-run win in the Melbourne Test, India made a strong start by ending at 303/4 in 90 overs on Thursday. Opener Mayank Agarwal was another solid performer, continuing his good form with a 77-run knock.To check if you're eligible to immigrate, Click hereAt stumps, Pujara (130) and Hanuma Vihari (39) were holding fort for the visiting side, which is in pursuit of a maiden Test series triumph on Australian soil. Virat Kohli's men have already secured the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with their unassailable lead.At the Sydney Cricket Ground, Pujara faced 250 balls, hitting 16 of them for fours, and added 75 runs for the unbeaten fifth wicket stand with Vihari.Post tea, Australia were able to make a quick breakthrough as Virat Kohli (23) was caught down leg. They had consistently bowled towards the leg-stump against the Indian skipper, cramping him for room and the ploy worked as he gloved behind off Josh Hazlewood (2-51) in the first over after the break.It brought Ajinkya Rahane (18) to the crease, who faced the same tactic. Cramping the batsmen for room, the hosts were able to put a check on the scoring rate as only 36 runs came in the first hour of play after tea.Unlike his counter-attacking style in the first three Tests, Rahane was subdued on this occasion as he looked to settle down. But Mitchell Starc (1-75) had him caught behind in the 71st over with a sharp-rising unplayable bouncer.India crossed 200 in the 63rd over, but needed a partnership at this juncture. Vihari proved to be a handy partner for Pujara as the duo put on 50 runs in 72 balls.Vihari kept the scoreboard ticking with minimum fuss, batting at a strike-rate of 67.2.He took pressure off Pujara at the other end, who was solid as ever, and celebrated his 18th Test hundred off 199 balls. In doing so, he went past 438 runs against England in 2012-13 as the most he had scored previously in a Test series.This was also the fourth time he faced 200-plus deliveries in the current series, going past Sunil Gavaskar's record of three such instances back in 1977-78.Earlier, Pujara put on 54 runs with Kohli as India reached 177-2 at tea. Post lunch, Agarwal and Pujara continued their second-wicket partnership to 116 runs. The duo put on an attacking show after the break, with their 100-run stand coming off 178 balls.Agarwal reached his second Test half-century off 96 balls, inclusive of two sixes against Nathan Lyon (1-88) as the two batsmen rotated strike well and kept the scoreboard ticking.India were scoring at a run-a-minute at one stage before drinks, as 64 runs came in the first hour of play after lunch.Agarwal looked good for a hundred but threw it away when he holed out in the deep off Lyon in the 34th over and walked back shaking his head at an unnecessary shot.Kohli then walked out to boos for the fourth Test running, but got going immediately with an immaculate cover drive. Australia resorted to more conservative bowling and kept his scoring rate in check.But they had no response to Pujara's grounding knock again, albeit with a different pace. Another 44 runs were added in the second hour of play, with Pujara reaching his half-century off 134 balls, including three fours in an over from leg spinner Marnus Labuschagne (0-25) before the tea break.In the morning, India were placed at 69-1 at lunch. This was after India won the toss and opted to bat. R Ashwin didn't pass the fitness test and was ruled out of this match. The visitors then made two changes, with KL Rahul and Kuldeep Yadav coming in for Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma.Australia too made two changes with Peter Handscomb and Marnus Labuschagne replacing Aaron Finch and Mitchell Marsh.Things didn't change much for Rahul (9) despite missing the Melbourne Test, as he edged twice in the first four balls faced only for the ball to go to the boundary.He didn't last long however, edging Hazlewood to first slip in the second over, and his nightmare run on this tour continued.This was the sixth opening pairing for India in 12 overseas Tests since January 2018, and only averages 21.56 in 23 overseas innings.At the other end, Agarwal settled down and stroked a couple of cover drives. He looked solid in comparison to his Karnataka teammate and along with Pujara, drove the Indian run-rate forward.In a series where low scoring has been the norm, India were scoring at 4.29 per over in the first hour as they reached 46-1 at drinks. India crossed 50 shortly thereafter, with the duo bringing on their 50-partnership off 104 balls.Australia lost a DRS review in the 15th over, when Hazlewood had a loud shout against Pujara turned down. There was nothing on the snickometer with the ball coming off the batsman's thighs.The hosts then resorted to run-saving tactics once again, and moved to a shorter length, targeting the batsmen's bodies. Pujara was hit a couple of times, once on the head.","Jan 03, 2019, 01:03 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/india-177/2-at-tea-on-day-one-of-sydney-test/articleshow/67360506.cms
Trading opportunity in realty stocks for next few months: Dipan Mehta,"
Investors are shifting from underperforming sectors to consumption stocks and corporate banks: Mehta.","Realty stocks have a bad track record for creating investor wealth and they could do well for a few months or so but these are certainly not long-term stocks where one can invest in three to five years or so, Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities Pvt Ltd, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: Will you buy more in the first month of 2019 or you are fully invested? More or less we are fully invested. Most investors also are more or less fully invested and maybe incremental savings could get diverted into the stock market as and when opportunities present themselves. In any case, before an earning season it is best to stay away and be in cash because when the numbers come, there are always positive and negative surprises. There is a high degree of volatility when companies announce their quarterly numbers and that provides an opportunity for entry or exit but there is no doubt that some amount of reshuffling is definitely taking place where churn is happening. Investors are getting away from the underperforming sectors, which could be commodities, pharmaceuticals, maybe even software into some of these sectors which are expected to do very well, especially the consumption oriented stocks and private sector banks and corporate banks. Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Interglobe Aviation Ltd  moved up by 3 in 3 months on a 10-point scale.                                                Subscribe Now                    Exclusively forStock Analysis                     Stock score of Interglobe Aviation Ltd is 5 on a scale of 10.                View Stock Analysis » So, some amount of churn is happening and there is divergence of growth and investors are taking advantage of sectors which are going to grow higher than the GDP growth rates and trying to be underweight on sectors which are facing some issue as far as demand or cost increases are concerned.On Corporate banks Yes that is true, The corporate banks have done well over the past few months or so and there is no doubt that going forward just because of lower provisioning, you will see a spurt in their profits and as and when they start getting their revenues growth growing, especially net interest as well as fee-based income going up, you will see a decent growth in their earnings more than at least some of the peer group banks like say HDFC or IndusInd Bank or RBL for that matter.  Some amount of money is definitely going over there. But I would say these stocks have maxed out though there is still scope for these stocks to outperform going forward. I would remain invested but may not make fresh investments. On real estate I do not think real estate will be an underperformer. They have gone through a lot of stress over the past two-three years. Lots of balance sheets, even of the likes of DLF are in the process of getting cleaned up. Debt levels for the listed players are certainly lower and many of the real estate companies are trading at decent discount to their net asset values. The main concern is that there is just far too much inventory. Any bit of positive news coming from the sector in terms of greater sales or lower inventories would act as trigger for the sector as a whole. Valuations are reasonable and many investors are still underweight as far as real estate stocks are concerned.  This sector can certainly be a market performer or even an outperformer but the strategy over here has to be to go for the companies which have got rental income as well. These will be the likes of Oberoi Realty or DLF because that would give a certain amount of stability to the earnings in a sector where earnings can be quite volatile depending upon the actual sales taking place which are certainly not linear. I would not be too negative on real estate per se.  It has gone through pains and now the time is ripe for them to gradually start outperforming but keep in mind that these are cyclical industries. They have a bad track record for creating investor wealth and they could do well for a few months or so but these are certainly not long-term stocks where one can invest in three to five years or so. The ROIs, ROEs remain quite unattractive. It is just that there is a nice trading opportunity in these stocks for the next few months or so. On aviation Definitely the best bet in the aviation industry is IndiGo and the woes of the competitor Jet and Air India certainly play into the hands of IndiGo. Scare about flight cancellation is ensuing that IndiGo gets benefits from that as more and more passengers are choosing a stronger airline. Their balance sheet is in a great shape and lower intensity on comparative pricing will benefit IndiGo and the sector as a whole and with fuel prices also coming down, I think we are going to see excellent numbers coming in from IndiGo over the next two-three quarters or so. So further trading bounce in IndiGo cannot be ruled out but there are certain structural issues with the industry. The comparative pressure tends to go up as and when the oil prices go down and then more players also start to build capacity over there. It is not like a nice secular structural growth story as far as the earnings are concerned but yes, it is on a cyclical upswing and the present scenario is such that the market leader IndiGo and to an extent SpiceJet will benefit tremendously and that will be reflected in their numbers as well. Investors who bought these stocks should remain invested. They have already moved up a lot so would not like to put fresh money at least over there. But for existing investors, it is a great hold and they could see at least 15-20% type of returns over the next few months from these two companies. On buy-on-dips opportunity in auto The pain in the auto sector may last for some more time and there are two major reasons for this. One is the base effect and second, the absence of new models across the board. Whether it is Maruti or Eicher or TVS, new models definitely drive auto sales and they have been generally not been launched at least in the past few months or so. That is affecting auto volumes per se, not to mention that there were higher cost of acquisition especially insurance cost and petrol prices were higher right up till at least about November, December or so and that certainly play on the minds of the consumer.  It is a mildly cyclical industry and it is best to stay away from it for some time. We have the advantage of monthly sales numbers. As and when we see monthly sales numbers getting into double digit, one could look at buying into these companies. Fortunately, some of the cost pressures has certainly reduced and that would provide some flexibility as far as pricing or discounting is concerned and some amount of at least protection of the margins.  I would say wait and watch. When the numbers start to improve, then that is the time to take up a plunge into these stocks. There is no doubt that there is considerable headroom for growth in a market like India for all segments in auto industry -- be it two-wheelers, four-wheelers or even commercial vehicles. The auto industry should always be on your radar. It is just that next few months could again show disappointing sales numbers and that would pin these stocks down.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:57 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/trading-opportunity-in-realty-stocks-for-next-few-months-dipan-mehta/articleshow/67360525.cms
Fiscal worries spook bond traders as farm package awaited,,"By Subhadip SircarFiscal worries are back to haunt India’s sovereign bonds just after they posted the best quarter in four years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party, which recently met with electoral losses in key states, is said to be preparing to unveil a farm-relief package ahead of general elections due by May. The prospect of substantial aid for farmers at a time when the nation’s tax and asset sales collections are lagging estimates is stoking fears that India may miss its fiscal deficit target.Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd  moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »“Fiscal concerns are again taking center-stage,” said Badrish Kulhalli, head of fixed income at HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. “Any extra spending on a large farm relief package when the government is falling short on indirect tax and divestment revenue may lead to a high fiscal slippage.”Modi is studying three options, including a cash handout for farmers, people with knowledge of the matter said, as his administration seeks to shore up support ahead of elections. A Reuters report last week put the cost of such a package at as much as Rs 3,00,000 crore ($42.7 billion), sending bond yields higher.Revenue under the goods and services tax will likely be one trillion rupees less than the government’s target, and this may push the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, according to Kotak Mahindra Bank’s estimates.The government has repeatedly said it will meet its budget shortfall target of 3.3 percent of GDP for the current financial year. Yields on the 10-year benchmark bond dropped 66 basis points last quarter as a slide in crude oil prices eased concerns about inflation and the central bank’s large-scale debt purchases boosted liquidity.Several states have also announced farm loan waivers, which will lead them to borrow more from the bond market, potentially adding to supply pressures. State governments will borrow as much as Rs 2.3 lakh crore this quarter, above market estimates.“While market is not expecting the fiscal slippage for current fiscal to necessary translate into extra borrowing through dated securities, the uncertainty with respect to next year’s fiscal target might warrant a cautious approach till the budget in February,” said Kuldeepsinh Jagtap, senior vice president at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd.

Supreme Court: Consensual physical relationship of live-in partners not rape,,"NEW DELHI: Consensual physical relationship between live-in partners does not amount to rape in case the man fails to marry the woman due to circumstances beyond his control, the Supreme Court has held.The top court said this while quashing an FIR lodged by a Maharashtra-based nurse against a doctor, who were in a live-in relationship ""for quite some time"".""Thus, there is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex. The court, in such cases, must very carefully examine whether the complainant had actually wanted to marry the victim or had mala fide motives and had made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the later falls within the ambit of cheating or deception,"" a bench of Justices A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer said in a recent verdict.The bench also said that if ""the accused has not made the promise with the sole intention to seduce the prosecutrix (woman) to indulge in sexual acts, such an act would not amount to rape"".According to the FIR, the woman, a widow, had fallen in love with the doctor and they started living together.""There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused and not solely on account of the misconception created by accused, or where an accused, on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen or which were beyond his control, was unable to marry her despite having every intention to do. Such cases must be treated differently,"" the bench said.It said if the man had any mala fide intention or clandestine motives, then it was a clear case of rape.""The acknowledged consensual physical relationship between the parties would not constitute an offence under section 376 (rape) of the IPC,"" the bench said.Referring to the facts of the case, the court said they were living together for quite some time and when the woman came to know that the man had married someone else, she lodged the complaint.""We are of the view that, even if the allegations made in the complaint are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, they do not make out a case against the appellant (doctor),"" the bench said.The man had approached the top court against the verdict of the Bombay High Court which had dismissed his plea seeking quashing of the FIR lodged against him.","Jan 03, 2019, 03:20 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/supreme-court-consensual-physical-relationship-of-live-in-partners-not-rape/articleshow/67360702.cms
"PM Narendra Modi to dine with sovereign fund representatives, not CEOs","While 2015 and 2017 editions hosted CEOs’ dinner with PM, this time it will be officials of 20 sovereign funds who will break bread with PM Narendra Modi","(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 03, 2019)There won't be CEOs' dinner with the PM in the 2019 edition of biennial Vibrant Gujarat Summit. Unlike 2015 and 2017 summits, when CEOs of Indian and international companies got to interact with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over dinner, this time representatives of 20 sovereign funds will get chance to break bread with the PM. The CEOs' dinner at previous two VGS had become marquee corporate events where the PM and top officials of his government interacted with industry leaders about the issues dogging their businesses. This time, however, it is the sovereign wealth funds controlled by nation states that have taken precedence over corporate giants.Talking to Mirror, Managing Director of iNDEXTb Rajkumar Beniwal said, ""It will be sovereign funds conclave instead of CEOs conclave and dinner this time."" Sovereign funds are investment funds controlled by nation states that invest money in international physical and financial assets like infrastructure projects, stocks, bonds and precious metals.Sources said the change in the event has been brought about as PM Modi is keen to attract sovereign funds for India's ambitious infrastructure projects. Vibrant Gujarat summit will provide these funds platform to pick and choose from wide array of infra projects in India.Sources associated with the development said the CEO dinners did not fetch much value to the event last time and hence the change. Also, the workshop conducted to address industry issues, on the lines of World Economic Forum at Davos, stands cancelled this time.The 2019 summit - which will see Australia, South Korea, Uzbekistan, Czech Republic, Morocco and Sweden participate for the first time - will also see trade exhibitions facilitating buyers and sellers place bulk orders.

Yet, only 10 Indians figure among the world’s top 1% highly-cited researchers (HCR) in the two fields. To top it, some of the 10 are not from the country’s leading institutes. The list, comprising over 4,000 of the globe’s most ‘influential’ researchers, in its fifth edition, has been released by the firm Clarivate Analytics.Eminent scientist and former head of the scientific advisory council to the prime minister, CNR Rao, figures on the list. A professor each from IIT-Kanpur, IITMadras, and JNU and two from NIT-Bhopal, too, are on the global HCR list, which covers over 60 countries, though more than 80% of the names come from only 10. Remarkably, 70% are from just five countries (see box). Among institutions, Harvard University has the highest representation on the list, with 186 names.To check if you're eligible to immigrate, Click hereWhile India’s representation is negligible, neighbor China is third on the list, ahead of Germany.JNU’s Dinesh Mohan, who figures on the list, said that till last year, less than five Indians would be on the list. “This year, they have included an additional category of ‘cross-field’, which took the number to 10,” he said. “Citations also depend on the nature of work. Areas such as climate change, water and energy are areas where research is more relevant nowadays. Where you publish your work is also important for impact.” Mohan’s team at JNU’s School of Environmental Sciences has come up with a sustainable solution to biomass burning by converting agricultural residue into biochar, which can improve soil fertility and crop production.Others Others Rao, who has been on the HCR list in its earlier editions and has over a lakh citations, said India must improve its quality of research, along with quantity to improve citations. “About 15 years ago, China and India were at the same level. But now China contributes to 15-16% of science in the world and ours is only about 3-4%.”Ashok Pandey, from CSIR’s Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, is the only HCR from CSIR, which has a network of over 5,000 scientists. “It is a matter of concern, and needs to be addressed by the government, and stakeholders, including scientists,” he said.IIT-Kanpur professor Avinash Agarwal, who is on the list, said applied research does not get enough respect in a country like India, which is obsessed with fundamental research. “We need to improve our research ecosystem... Predatory journals, where you pay and publish, need to be heavily penalised. There is a lack of focus on quality research in Indian academia,” he said. “Also, teaching and research are two sides of the same coin. If teachers do not do high quality research, they will not be updated with new developments.”The other Indian names on the HCR list are: Alok and Jyoti Mittal (a married couple; Jyoti is the only woman researcher on the list) from NIT Bhopal; Rajnish Kumar from IIT-Madras; Sanjeeb Sahoo from Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneshwar; Rajeev Varshney from International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Hyderabad; Sakthivel Rathinaswamy from Bharathiar University, Coimbatore.The reasons why India has minuscule representation on the list include socio-economic and cultural factors, the nature of academics in the country, and also brain drain. Also, India’s top institutes are primarily centres for theoretical research. “The pure science research has become highly specialised. Scientists from pure sciences tend to have a very small peer group. There will not be many researchers from pure sciences even on the global HCR list,” said Mayank Vahia, a former TIFR professor who is now the dean of the School of Mathematical Sciences, NMIMS, explaining why researchers from the pure sciences do not have good citation indices. “On the contrary, research in applied sciences is directly related to industry, is of immediate utility value and also has larger reach.”In India, even in applied research, Vahia said, industry investments for long-term projects are not significant, compared to the US. Commenting on the list, he said, “Technology is patented and put to use, and the focus is not much on publications, leading to the poor numbers.”","Jan 03, 2019, 11:13 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/only-10-indians-on-list-of-worlds-4000-top-scientists/articleshow/67360561.cms

Mohan Bhagwat unsure about result of 2019 Lok Sabha polls?,,"(This story originally appeared in  on Jan 03, 2019)NAGPUR: Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that an ordinance on Ram Temple can happen only after the legal process is over, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said “irrespective of what the PM says, my stance is clear on the issue. We have faith in Ram and also strongly believe the temple should be built at the site in Ayodhya”.Speaking on the sidelines of an event in Sewadan School here on Wednesday, Bhagwat said he endorsed the statement by Bhaiyyaji Joshi , RSS Sarkaryavaha, his deputy, which came soon after the PM’s interview on Monday. Importantly, in his speech at the event, Bhagwat appeared to refer to uncertainty about the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls. Speaking on education policy he said “the policy needs to be changed. It is learnt a new policy has been framed but there is not much time left. Its implementation depends on how things take shape in future.”Joshi, who spoke to reporters on Tuesday after the Prime Minister’s comments on Ram temple, had said RSS was firm on its stance that it wanted a law on building the temple at Ayodhya. Clarifying he was not aware of what Modi’s statement was, Joshi said everyone in the country wanted Ram Temple to be built. A day later Bhagwat said he fully agreed with what Joshi said. However, a tweet on RSS’s official handle which soon followed the PM’s interview appeared to be agreeing with Modi’s statement in the TV interview. It read, “we feel the statement by PM is a positive step in the direction of temple construction. The PM reiterating the resolve to construct a grand Sri Ram Temple in Ayodhya in his interview is in tune with the resolution passed by BJP at Palampur in 1989.""","Jan 03, 2019, 11:47 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/mohan-bhagwat-unsure-about-result-of-2019-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/67361218.cms

They take care of the enemy. We just can't do that,"" Trump said.""So, I look forward to meeting with the new leadership in Pakistan. We will be doing that in the not too distant future.

The cricketer-turned politician said in January last year that meeting President Trump would be a ""bitter pill"" to swallow.Just a month ago, Trump wrote a letter to Khan, seeking Pakistan's help with stuttering Afghan peace talks and support in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table to end the 17-year brutal war in the neighbouring country.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Prime Minister Khan in Islamabad in September last year and pressed him to take ""sustained and decisive measures"" against terrorists threatening the regional peace and stability.The relations between Pakistan and the US nosedived last year in January after President Trump accused Islamabad of giving nothing to Washington but ""lies and deceit"" and providing ""safe haven"" to terrorists.The US has repeatedly said that Pakistan was providing safe havens to the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militants to attack US soldiers in Afghanistan.The US Congress also passed a bill to slash Pakistan's defence aid to USD 150 million, significantly below the historic level of more than USD one billion per year.The Trump administration announced early last year that it was suspending security assistance to Pakistan over differences on Afghanistan but indicated that training programmes for military officers will continue.","Jan 03, 2019, 11:56 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/pakistan-houses-enemies-donald-trump/articleshow/67361334.cms

Why betting on debt mutual funds is important in 2019,"MF managers and advisors believe, after a volatile 2018, debt funds are very well placed in the market and should offer `good' returns to the investors.","Mutual fund managers and advisors believe that debt fund will do well in 2019. After a volatile 2018, debt funds are very well placed in the market and should offer `good' returns to the investors, they say. That is why mutual fund advisors want investors to focus on their debt mutual funds in 2019. “After the fall in equities last year, investors should understand the importance of debt mutual funds in their portfolio. I believe this year, investors should focus on debt mutual funds equally as they are expected to do well and will raise the portfolio returns,” says Vivekh Pathak, Founder, Finance and You.Just like the equity market, the debt market also witnessed a lot of volatility in 2018. The volatility was primarily attributed to uncertain macro economic indicators. Rise in crude oil prices, rising interest rates, yields going up, currency depreciation and liquidity tightening were the major reasons for the volatility in the debt mutual fund category in 2018.Despite the volatility, debt mutual fund categories topped the charts and outperformed many equity mutual fund categories in the last one year. Liquid fund category was the best performer among the debt mutual fund categories with a return of 6.89 per cent in one year. Long duration funds stood on the second spot with 6.84 per cent returns followed by Gilt funds with 6.56 per cent returns and short duration funds with 6.00 per cent in one year. “I think, last year was indeed a very volatile year, largely because the rates moved higher. The overall yields went up because the macro was very uncertain. But now, the uncertainties are reversing. Oil has come down almost 30-35 per cent, currency has stabilised, OMOs have got the liquidity back to the market. Continuous OMOs from RBI will mean that the G-secs will remain stronger. This looks like a good year for the debt funds,” says Kumaresh Ramakrishnan, Head of Fixed Income at DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers.Ramakrishnan believes that with inflation remaining benign, the expectations of monetary easing by the RBI are high. “Investors who didn’t move out of their schemes last year during the volatility will definitely be rewarded this year. And I would say that investors should continue investing in debt mutual funds largely for these reasons- yields will do better in 2019 and we might see rate easing by April,” says Kumaresh Ramakrishnan. He advises investors to stay in short duration funds. “The one to three year segment, short-duration funds, remains very attractive. I think that is the best spot for investors in 2019,” Ramakrishnan adds.However, mutual fund advisors ask investors to not think of debt funds as the flavour of the season and stick to their asset allocation. “Debt mutual funds did better than equity funds last year. But there was volatility there as well. We cannot make tall claims of debt funds doing great in 2019 and allocate large sums to them,"" says Deepali Sen, Founder of Srujan Financial Advisors. ""There should be a mix of assets according to the investor’s risk profile and investment horizon and they should continue investing. Yes, investors should understand that debt mutual funds are important for your overall portfolio returns in the long run,” adds Deepali Sen.

Amazon Echo Sub review: No more bass complaints,The Echo Sub is like a  ‘wireless’ sub-woofer that'll fill the room with deep bass.,"Price: Rs 12,999Rating: ****1/2Specifications: 100 Watt Class D digital amplifier, 50 – 200Hz adaptive low-pass filter, 4 litre sealed chamber with 6-inch down-firing subwoofer, 100-240 volt universal voltage (auto switching, internal power supply), WiFi n (supports 2.4 & 5Ghz networks), 4.2kgPros: Adds deep, thumping bass to your existing Echo speaker, quick setup, universal voltage, wireless designCons: Expensive, can’t be paired with two different types of Echo speakers in 2.1 setupOne of more frequent complaints about Amazon’s Echo speakers is that they can’t match the fidelity of larger sound systems. You may even get a couple of them and use them in a multi-room setup but there’s one important piece of the audio puzzle that will still elude you: bass.Amazon solved this problem with the Echo Sub, a standalone Echo speaker that only produces bass frequencies. It’s designed to be paired with an existing Echo or Echo Plus. You can set it up as a 1.1 system (paired with one Echo) or as a 2.1 system (pair it with two similar Echo speakers for a stereo effect). Setting it up is just like adding a speaker to your Amazon account and creating a multi-room system. In any case, the Amazon Alexa app will guide you through the setup process which just takes a couple of minutes. Amazon Wants To Take Over With Redesigned Echo, Smart Clocks, MicrowaveAutoplay1 of 12On The Way To World DominationAmazon caused a few gasps at its Alexa event Thursday when it revealed it had 70 things to announce. The new products give Amazon a greater reach than ever before. Updates to the internet giant's Alexa-infused Echo smart speakers will allow them to tend to microwave cooking and even have ""hunches"" regarding what users may want or have forgotten. Alexa is even developing a personality, complete with a favorite pet or beer. Here's a round up all of the Alexa-infused products Amazon showcased, including speakers, an in-car device and, a microwave:Echo DotThe revamped Echo Dot has a new look, with rounded edges, and packs more punch, with a 1.6-inch driver delivering 70-per cent-louder audio than the previous model. The speaker has lower distortion and enhanced bass. It can connect to other speakers and other apps and devices over Bluetooth. Echo SubIf you're craving more low-end tones from your Echo setup, you might consider the Echo Sub. It delivers down-firing, 100W of bass through its 6-inch woofer, and you can pair it with an Echo or two to create a 2.1 stereo system. Echo PlusAmazon updated its Echo Plus, which includes a smart hub for a range of connected devices. This time around, it has revamped speakers and a feature called local voice control, which lets you adjust your various smart-home devices even if your internet connection is down. There's a temperature sensor too, so Echo Plus can tell smart thermostats to turn up the heat when it gets a little chilly. Echo InputNot to be outdone by Chromecast Audio, Amazon has its own audio dongle called Echo Input, including Bluetooth, a microphone and a 3.5mm jack. It doesn't have a speaker, so you'll need to connect it to your existing audio setup.       The Sub itself is a large unit designed to placed on the ground. Since it only needs a power supply, you can place it somewhere hidden, like under a table or behind a sofa. In that sense, it is a ‘wireless’ sub-woofer. Inside it is a 100 watt digital amplifier and a 6-inch, high excursion, down-firing sub-woofer that instantly fills the room with deep bass.It is significantly larger and heavier than a typical Echo speaker: 8-inches high, 8.3-inches across and 4.2 kg. This is for good reason too. It needs the large enclosure for the sub-woofer and the weight keeps it firmly planted when it’s pushing out large quantities of air. Since the Sub is not designed to be a standalone unit, there are no controls for volume on it — it increases/decreases volume in tandem with the Echo speaker it’s paired to. However, you can fine tune the audio by going into the device settings on the app.Overall, adding the Sub is a massive improvement to the audio quality. It stays perfectly synced with the speaker you paired it with. The only couple of downsides are the price (add Rs 12,999 to the price of an Echo) and that it takes half a second extra to respond when you change tracks or ask Alexa to execute a command (which is normal for a multi-room speaker setup). Google Home vs Amazon Echo: Which smarter speaker suits you the best?Google has launched its voice-activated speakers 'Home' in the Indian market as it looks to take on rival devices. Powered by Google Assistant, Home and Home Mini are priced at Rs 9,999, and Rs 4,499, respectively and will be available online exclusively on Flipkart and in over 750 retail stores. Here is a comparison between the new entrant and Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo, which debuted in India last year with starting price of Rs 4,499. Tune in.

Why ICICIdirect’s Pankaj Pandey is sure this stock is going to bounce back,"
“The next six months are going to be quite good for hospitality sector.”","Somany Ceramics has corrected about 60% odd and whatever could go wrong has gone wrong for the company,           Pankaj Pandey, HoR, ICICIdirect.com, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: Do you expect continued pressure on Jet? With comparatively lower crude prices, would one find favour in SpiceJet and Interglobe? Previously, we had Jet under coverage, but now we had dropped it. The challenge with Jet has been that irrespective of cycles, we have never seen the overall debt coming down which was slightly surprising and structurally we are not positive on the entire aviation space.  Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Bank of Baroda Ltd  moved down by 1 in a month on a 10-point scale.                                                Subscribe Now                    Exclusively forStock Analysis                     Stock score of Bank of Baroda Ltd is 9 on a scale of 10.                View Stock Analysis »The primary reason is that the tier I airports are choked for capacity. Going forward, there is a good chance that somewhere down the line, auctioning of slots could happen and that might put further pressure on aviation companies. Considering Jet has already defaulted, for equity investors, there is nothing much to look at except for the fact that if they get a new owner and probably the company gets a lease of life. Then only, there is a case for but that will take some bit of time. Till that time, I do not think one should really be chasing it even from a trading perspective.What has gone wrong with Eicher? Exactly a year ago, which is Jan 2018, it was hard to find a single bear on Eicher Motors? You are right. Even we had an expectation that the company would deliver overall volumes of about 9.5 lakh for this year but what is coming out is that even 8 lakh would be a difficult number to achieve. Last month’s number is a bit surprising given the fact that ideally this was a normal sort of month. In the earlier months, we had seen some bit of impact of strike and other challenges. But this was expected in a month where the sales should have shown a decent growth. But the company has disappointed on that front and the challenge for Eicher is that Eicher has always been liked for the kind of growth which they have delivered over a period of time. If that growth is faltering, then valuations will have to take a knock because compared to other two-wheeler manufacturers there was always valuation premium for Eicher for its growth. Now if that growth is not coming, then the multiples will have to take a knock and my sense is that if the numbers do not really improve, you will see further downsides from current levels. What makes you upbeat on the hospitality sector? What we have seen is specifically in case of hotels as a segment, demand has been growing in the range to 6-7 per cent odd whereas the supply has been sort of growing only at about 4% odd. So, structurally things have turned very positive for the sector in terms of higher occupancy rates which we are already witnessing and in the next cycle, we would expect a decent growth in the ARRs. We would also expect occupancy levels to inch up from the overall 65% to 75% odd.  The next six months for the sector are quite good. So 60% of the revenues come in these two quarters. For a lot of these companies, the cost is fixed in nature. If my ARRs improve, the delta on the bottom line is quite high. We like the entire hospitality space, whether it is Indian Hotels, Taj GVK, EIH. All these players should do well going forward. These are our top picks in the sector. Would you be gung-ho on the prospects of BoB after the merger and how skewed is it in favour of BoB shareholders? Or would you restrict yourself to private corporate banks? Following the three-way merger between Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank, the overall book value of the combined entity will increase. On BoB, we had an earlier target price of Rs 135 and typically most of these PSU banks trade around one time book value. From that perspective, Rs 7-8 kind of an upside could be possible but structurally, the merger hangover is what we had witnessed in the case of SBI. That had impacted the price performance because SBI did literally nothing in the past two or three years. Something similar could pan out for BoB also wherein higher employee cost and higher provisioning because of the NPAs overall probably may not really drive a structural outperformance in the stock. Within PSUs, SBI is one of the best placed because it is already behind all these challenges. Which is that one stock where right now the news is bad, the selling is large and you are reasonably confident of an uptick?  Within our yearly picks, Somany Ceramics has corrected about 60% odd and whatever could go wrong has gone wrong for the company; one, gas prices had gone up to about Rs 40 per scm and there were challenges because of Kerala floods because that contributes about 12-13% of their overall sales.  Then there were gas infrastructure challenges as a result of which, there was a production loss of over 8% odd. As a result of all these, their margins had actually come down from 13.5% to about 6.7% odd. We sense that overall things will improve from here-on and margins should ideally improve to about 10% odd in the next two years. And with the kind of beating the stock has taken, we would expect it to recover some of the lost ground. We have a target price of Rs 410 on the stock and we like the stock within the stocks that have corrected substantially last year.

Sabarimala: Supreme Court declines urgent hearing on contempt plea against authorities,The apex court had last September allowed the entry of women of all age groups into the temple.,"The Supreme Court Thursday refused urgent hearing of a contempt petition moved by two women against Chief Priest of Sabarimala temple and its authorities for closing the shrine after two females of menstruating age group entered it, breaking a centuries-old tradition.A bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice S K Kaul said the contempt petition will be heard along with the pending review petitions against the September 28 apex court verdict which allowed women of all age groups to enter the temple.""We cannot constitute a separate bench for hearing the contempt petition,"" the bench said, adding that the contempt petition will be heard on January 22 along with pending review petitions.Advocate P V Dinesh, appearing for petitioners Varsha and Geena Kumari, told the bench that the temple authorities closed the shrine Wednesday for purification after the women entered it.The apex court had last September allowed the entry of women of all age groups into the temple.Bringing to the notice of the court, yesterday's events Dinesh requested for early listing of the contempt petition filed on November 16 against the chief priest and other temple authorities alleging that women were being not allowed to enter Sabarimala temple despite the apex court's verdict.On Wednesday, two women of menstruating age group had stepped into the Sabarimala temple of Lord Ayyappa, breaking a centuries-old tradition and defying dire threats from the Hindu right.Kanakadurga, 44, and Bindu, 42, stepped into the hallowed precincts guarded by police three months after the apex court's historic judgement lifting the ban on entry of girls and women between 10 and 50 years of age into the shrine of Lord Ayyappa, its ""eternally celibate"" deity.Following the entry of the women into the shrine, the chief priest had decided to close the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in order to perform the 'purification' ceremony.Despite the Supreme Court's historic ruling on September 28 last year, permitting women in the 10-50 age group, no children or young women in the 'barred' group were able to offer prayers at the shrine following frenzied protests by devotees and right-wing outfits.

"Government lists key steps taken to spur MSME growth, ease compliances in 2018","The MSME sector which has been hit hard by demonetisation and by the haphazard implementation of GST, is a crucial vote bank and with 2019 general elections around the corner, the government wants to get the right message across. ","For the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, 2018 remained a year characterised by a rather challenging business environment, the Government on Wednesday came out with a report card on what it has done for the sector.Released by the Finance Ministry, the communication sought to highlight the key achievements, measures taken and the proactive nature of the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The MSME sector which has been hit hard by demonetisation and by the haphazard implementation of GST, is a crucial vote bank and with 2019 general elections around the corner, the government wants to get the right message across. Access to CreditThe biggest achievement for the government here was the launch of the 59-minute loan portal to enable easy access to credit for MSMEs. During the launch Modi said loans upto Rs 1 crore can now be granted in-principle approval through a dedicated portal launched for this purpose. Bringing relief to GST compliant MSMEs, Modi had further announced a two-percent interest subvention for all GST registered MSMEs, on fresh or incremental loans. To help ease working capital woes of exporting fraternity, Modi also announced an increase in interest rebate from three percent to five percent for exporters who receive loans in the pre-shipment and post-shipment period.Further, companies with a turnover more than Rs 500 crore have been asked to join the Trade Receivables e-Discounting System (TReDS) portal. Joining the portal will enable entrepreneurs to access credit from banks, based on their upcoming receivables, opined Modi. Access to MarketsAccording to the government another significant measure aimed at enhancing access to markets for entrepreneurs, Modi said that Public Sector Companies have now been asked to compulsorily procure 25 percent, instead of 20 percent of their total purchases, from MSMEs.Mentioning that 1.5 lakh suppliers have now registered with Government eMarketplace (GeM), out of which 40,000 are MSMEs, Modi further made it clear that all Public Sector Undertakings of the Union Government must now compulsorily be a part of GeM. He reiterated that all such PSUs should also get their vendors registered on GeM.Additionally, to support women entrepreneurs, the government has maintained that, out of the 25 percent procurement mandated from MSMEs, three percent must now be reserved for women entrepreneurs.Technology UpgradationOn technological upgradation front, keeping into account the importance of tool rooms as a vital part of product design, Modi announced that 20 hubs, and 100 spokes in the form of tool rooms will soon be introduced across the country. Ease of Doing BusinessFor facilitating a more conducive business environment for MSMEs, a number of measures have been introduced by the government last year. Noteworthy is, as part of the changed norm, the return under eight labour laws and 10 Union regulations must now be filed only once a year.Further, for inspection purposes, the establishments to be visited by an inspector will now be decided through a computerised random allotment. The government noted that as part of establishing a unit, an entrepreneur now needs only two clearances namely -- environmental clearance and consent to establish. Since both air pollution and water pollution laws have now been merged, these, would subsequently require a single consent and any related return will be accepted through self-certification.With regard to minor violations under the Companies Act, an ordinance has now been introduced by the government, under this, entrepreneurs will no longer have to approach the courts, instead, they can take remedial measures themselves through simple procedures. Social Security for MSME Sector EmployeesDuring last year, the government highlighted the need for introducing social security for the MSME sector employees. The finance ministry note says that a mission will be launched to ensure that they have Jan Dhan Accounts, Provident Fund and Insurance. Modi added that the implementation of such an 'Outreach Programme' for monitoring Social Security for MSME Sector Employees will be intensively monitored over the next 100 days.

45 Lok Sabha members suspended in 2 days for disruptions,Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has suspended 45 Lok Sabha members belonging to the TDP and the AIADMK since Wednesday after they created ruckus in the House and continuously disrupted proceedings for days.,"New Delhi: Cracking the whip on unruly MPs , Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has suspended 45 Lok Sabha members belonging to the TDP and the AIADMK since Wednesday after they created ruckus in the House and continuously disrupted proceedings for days.Mahajan had suspended 24 AIADMK members on Wednesday for five consecutive sittings. A day later, she suspended 21 members of AIADMK and TDP and an unattached YSR Congress member. The action was taken under rule 374A of Lok Sabha which says that they cannot attend the remaining days of the session, which concludes on January 8.While AIADMK has 37 members, the TDP has 15 in the lower house.Action against such a large number of MPs is unusual. In February, 2014, the then Speaker Meira Kumar had suspended 18 MPs from Andhra Pradesh following bedlam in the House. Those suspended then were either supporting or opposing creation of Telangana.Proceeding in Lok Sabha during the winter session that commenced on December 11 have been repeatedly stalled due to protests by AIADMK and TDP members over a proposed dam on river Cauvery and special state status to Andhra Pradesh respectively.While 19 MPs were suspended around noon on Thursday, two others were asked to leave the House around 2.00 pm.As soon as the Zero Hour commenced at noon on Thursday, AIADMK and TDP members trooped in the Well, raising slogans and carrying banners.The AIADMK members flung papers towards the chair several times. Amid the ruckus, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar appealed to the agitating MPs to return to their seats. However, protests by the unrelenting members of the two Southern parties continued.At this, the Speaker initially warned that she would be forced to name the unruly members and take action against them.""I warn you, I will take you names. You have come to the Well and are persistently creating trouble,"" she said.As the members refused to budge, the Speaker suspended 11 TDP MPs, seven AIADMK members and an unattached member under Rule 374(A) for the next four sitting of the House.Among the suspended MPs were former Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju (TDP), Thota Narasimham (TDP) and Renuka Butta (unattached) who had won on a YSR Congress ticket.""You are wilfully obstructing the proceedings of the House. I am, therefore, constrained to name you and suspend you for four consecutive days,"" Mahajan said.The Speaker subsequently adjourned the House till 2 pm after conducting business for nearly 15 minutes during the Zero Hour.When the House met again at 2 pm, some members continued protest in the Well despite being suspended.She then suspended two more TDP membes for disrupting proceedings. Amid the din, the House was adjourned for the day without taking up the remaining part of debate on the Rafale issue.Meanwhile, some pictures being shared on social media purportedly showed TDP members standing on the Speaker's podium and holding placards when the House was adjourned soon after noon.They had not left the Lok Sabha chamber even after the House was adjourned.Two questions were taken up during the Question Hour even as the members continued to shout slogans.Members from the Congress wanted to raise the Sabarimala issue and Mahajan told them that the matter can be raised later.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:28 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lok-sabha-adjourns-till-noon-amid-protests-by-aiadmk-tdp/articleshow/67361730.cms

Most Asian currencies weaken as growth fears set off 'flash crash',"The won weakened as much as 0.9 per cent at one point to 1,128.40 per dollar.","Most Asian currencies softened against the dollar on Thursday, with the Korean won leading declines, as wary investors dashed to safer assets amid deepening global growth risks. The won weakened as much as 0.9 per cent at one point to 1,128.40 per dollar, its lowest in two weeks, before paring some losses. Aggravating worries about cooling global growth, Apple Inc on Wednesday issues a rare revenue warning and cut its quarterly sales forecast, citing slowing growth in emerging markets and weak sales in China. The news helped trigger a 'flash crash' in currency markets, with the Japanese yen soaring 1.6 per cent versus the greenback, which has been hobbled by a US government shutdown. ""Emerging market currencies weakened amid intensified risk aversion,"" said Qi Gao, FX Strategist (EM Asia) at Scotiabank. ""The yen rallied as it is a traditional safe-haven currency."" On Wednesday, data showed weaker factory activity across much of Asia in December as the Sino-US trade war dampened export demand. The Taiwan dollar and the Indian rupee fell 0.3 per cent each, while the Chinese yuan and the Malaysian ringgit were marginally weaker. Elsewhere, the Philippine peso ticked down ahead of inflation data due on Friday. Inflation is expected to slow to a six-month low in December on easing food and fuel prices, a Reuters poll showed, raising the chances of the central bank leaving interest rates unchanged this year. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas left its key rate on hold in December after five successive rate hikes. The rupiah was marginally lower versus the dollar after December inflation cooled. Bank Indonesia has less need to hike rates again given that inflation appears well-contained and dollar weakness is taking pressure off the rupiah, Mizuho Bank said in a note to clients. The central bank governor said on Wednesday that he expects the rupiah's exchange rate to be more stable this year compared with 2018. Last year, the rupiah plunged to its weakest since the Asian financial crisis 20 years ago, before recovering towards the end of the year on increased capital inflows.

"Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif denied helper in jail, told to maintain room on his own",​​​Sharif has been serving a seven-year jail term in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills graft case and being a former prime minister he is entitled to better facilities including an orderly who is from prisoners. ,"Pakistan's incarcerated former premier Nawaz Sharif will maintain his jail room on his own as the Punjab province government on Wednesday refused to provide him a prisoner who could serve as his orderly, according to a media report. Sharif has been serving a seven-year jail term in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills graft case and being a former prime minister he is entitled to better facilities including an orderly who is from prisoners. Punjab's Inspector General of Prisons Shahid Saleem Beg said on Wednesday that Punjab government decided that it could not provide a prisoner to Sharif who could serve as his orderly and that he would have to maintain his room on his own, the Dawn reported. The prisons chief said ""Nawaz Sharif has been asked to maintain his room"" to serve out the seven-year ""rigorous"" imprisonment handed down to him in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills/Hill Metal Establishment reference. Speaking to media personnel in the presence of Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar at the Governor House, the prisons chief said Sharif's case was highly sensitive and he could not be allowed to go outside his barracks in the prison. He said Sharif's ""rigour had been kept within his barracks"".According to the jail manual, he said, the former premier had been asked to maintain his room himself. However, he later clarified to the daily that Sharif had not been put to any rigour, adding that the manual allowed elderly inmates certain concessions on that count. ""Any issue related to Nawaz Sharif in jail could bring a bad name to Pakistan,"" Beg said. An anti-corruption court in Pakistan on December 24 sentenced the ousted premier to seven years in jail in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills graft case but acquitted him in the Flagship Investments case, concluding a series of three court cases against the Sharif family in the high-profile Panama Papers case.The Al-Azizi Steel Mill case was about setting up steel mills in Saudi Arabia allegedly with corruption money. Three cases - Avenfield properties case, Flagship investment case and Al-Azizia steel mills case - were launched against the Sharif family by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on September 8, 2017 following a judgment by the Supreme Court that disqualified Sharif in the Panama Papers case in July last year.","Jan 03, 2019, 12:26 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/former-pakistan-pm-nawaz-sharif-denied-helper-in-jail-told-to-maintain-room-on-his-own/articleshow/67361875.cms
"Kerala: CM Pinarayi Vijayan lashes out at BJP, RSS for violence during hartal","Vijayan said the two women were not ""airdropped"" to Sabarimala but went as normal devotees and the other pilgrims did not protest.","Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan Thursday lashed out at the BJP and the RSS over protests against the entry of two women into the Sabarimala temple, saying the violence unleashed by them will be dealt with strongly. Vijayan said the two women were not ""airdropped"" to Sabarimala but went as normal devotees and the other pilgrims did not protest.  ""Kanakadurga and Bindu were given protection after they sought security to visit the shrine. They were not airdropped. They visited shrine like normal devotees. None of the devotees protested,"" he told reporters here.  The chief minister also said that conducting hartal over women's entry into the shrine was like calling hartal against the Supreme Court's order.  Coming down heavily on the chief priest's action of closing the temple for purification ceremony, Vijayan said this was against the apex court's verdict.  ""Such things are to be decided by the Devaswom Board. The action was not only a violation of the Supreme Court's verdict but also against the rules of the board,"" Vijayan added.  Widespread violence was witnessed in the state after two women of the traditionally barred age group visited the shrine early Wednesday.  A total of 79 KSRTC buses were damaged in stone-pelting. Many media personnel, including women, were attacked and 31 policemen were injured.  CPI(M) party offices were also attacked at many places. Right-wing parties and a section of devotees under the aegis of Sabarimala Karma Samiti have been protesting against the September 28 verdict of the apex court allowing women of all ages into the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa.  Following the entry of the two women, the Samiti, had called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal Thursday, which was being supported by the BJP.","Jan 03, 2019, 12:28 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-lashes-out-at-bjp-rss-for-violence-during-hartal/articleshow/67361892.cms

As and when required we will list the matter.""According to the government's December 20 notification, 10 central probe and snoop agencies are now empowered under the Information Technology (IT) Act for computer interception and analysis, Ministry of Home Affairs officials had said.The 10 agencies notified under the new order are the Intelligence Bureau, Narcotics Control Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (for Income Tax Department), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, Directorate of Signal Intelligence (in service areas of J-K, North East and Assam) and Delhi Police commissioner.In his petition, Sharma had termed the notification as ""illegal, unconstitutional and ultra vires to the law"".He had also sought to prohibit the agencies from initiating any criminal proceedings, enquiry or investigation against anybody under the provisions of the IT Act based on the notification.The plea had claimed that the notification was issued ""to find political opponent, thinker and speaker to control entire country under dictatorship to win coming general election under an undisclosed emergency as well as slavery which cannot be permitted within the Constitution of India"".It had alleged that the Ministry of Home Affairs' ""blanket surveillance order must be tested against fundamental right to privacy"".As per the notification, the state has the right to access every communication, computer and mobile and ""to use it to protect political interest and object of the present executive political party"", the petition had alleged.The government's move authorising the 10 central agencies to intercept information from any computer had set off a political storm with the opposition accusing the Centre of trying to create a ""surveillance state"".However, the central government had said the rules for intercepting and monitoring computer data were framed in 2009 when the Congress-led UPA was in power and its new order only notified the designated authority which can carry out such action.","Jan 03, 2019, 02:21 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sc-to-hear-as-and-when-required-pil-against-authorising-agencies-to-intercept-any-computer/articleshow/67361931.cms
Dawn-to-dusk shutdown in Kerala over Sabarimala row turns violent,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Sangh Parivar forces have pledged their support to the Sabarimala Karma Samithi shutdown call, and their activists are enforcing it.","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala was in ferment on Thursday, a day after two women of menstruating age entered the Sabarimala temple, infuriating saffron outfits, with protesters blocking roads by placing burning tyres and granite blocks, and clashes leaving three BJP workers injured in a knife attack, officials said.The dawn to dusk shutdown called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organisation of various pro-Hindutva groups, and the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), plunged the state into turmoil, as hundreds of Hindu right-wing activists disrupted vehicular movement, and vandalised shops and offices of the ruling CPI(M).The state was under siege as strike supporters clashed with police and the ruling CPI(M) activists at several places.In Thrissur, three BJP activists were stabbed during a clash with workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of Popular Front of India, a militant Islamic outfit, police said.Most state-run buses kept off the roads after several of them were damaged in Wednesday's violence, while only a few autorickshaws plied in cities and towns.A 55-year-old man, who was seriously injured when CPI (M) workers hurled stones at protesters from atop their party office at Pandalam in Pathanamthitta district, died late Wednesday night.However, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told media that the man, Chandran Unnithan, died due to cardiac arrest.Unnithan was part of the protest march taken out by Sabarimala Karma Samiti on Wednesday evening which came under attack by CPI(M) workers.Nine people accused of involvement in the attack have been identified and two of them arrested, police said.As tempers ran high in Kerala, the Supreme Court Thursday refused to urgently hear a contempt petition moved by a lawyers' group against Sabarimala temple authorities for closing the shrine for purification after two women entered it.A bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice S K Kaul said that the contempt petition will be heard along with the pending review petitions against the apex court verdict which allowed women of all age groups to enter the Sabarimala temple.Advocate P V Dinesh appearing for Indian Young Lawyers Association told the bench that the temple authorities closed the shrine Wednesday for purification after the women's entry which was in violation of the apex court verdict.Vijayan, who blamed the BJP-RSS combine for the violence, warned of stern action against the perpetrators.He told reporters here that the government was not against the belief of the believers, but owed allegiance to the Constitution.""There was a clear planning to the violence unleashed by the hartal supporters. Since yesterday, there has been so much violence. Media personnel, including women, and police were among those attacked,"" Vijayan said.Seventynine state transport corporation buses were vandalised and 31 police personnel injured in violence, he said.""Most of those attacked were women. Many shops have been damaged by Sangh Parivar. Offices of CPI(M), CPI have been vandalised and attacked in the state,"" Vijayan said.Protest demonstrations by the BJP and Sabarimala Karma Samithi turned violent at several places in Kozhikode, Kannur Malappuram, Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram.Police used batons and water canons to break up protests.The office of the CPI at Palakkad was attacked by the protesters and the vehicles parked in front of it, including state transport corporation buses, auto-rickshaws and police vehicles were pelted with stones.Agitators hurled a crude bomb at a local beedi manufacturing unit managed by the CPI(M) in Thalassery in Kannur district, but it did not explode, police said, adding 10 right-wing activists were arrested.Another crude bomb was thrown at Nedumangadu police station about 17 km from here, officials said. It was not immediately known whether it went off and caused any damage.Journalists staged a protest march in the state capital after they were allegedly assaulted by protesters. The state's police chief Lok Nath Behera said a special team will probe the assault on media.Normal life was thrown haywire because of the shutdown, as shops and hotels remained shuttered in the state capital.However, defying the 'Hartal' call, some shopkeepers opened their establishments on SM Street, a major trade hub in Kozhikode, besides a few places in Kochi and Kollam under police security.CPI(M) offices were pelted with stones in Ernakulam and Mallapuram districts, while a library managed by the party in Palakkad was also vandalised.Some Youth Congress workers were injured when they were hit by the pilot vehicle of the chief minister's convoy while they attempted to show black flags to Vijayan.The Congress is observing a 'black day' against the entry of women into the Sabarimala shrine, the abode of its perenially celibate deity Lord Ayyappa.Bindu and Kanakadurga, two women in their 40s, had defied dire threats from saffron organisations and offered prayers at the temple that was out of bounds for girls and women between 10 and 50 years of age, breaking the centuries- old tradition and infuriating the Hindu right.Scores of protesters were arrested from different parts of the state for breaking peace.The state's universities postponed the examinations scheduled for Thursday.","Jan 03, 2019, 06:47 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/dawn-to-dusk-shutdown-in-kerala-over-sabarimala-row/articleshow/67362049.cms
IPL 2019 venue under speculation due to clash of dates with LS elections,It’s been learnt that a BCCI delegation met ministry officials – apparently on the directions of BCCI CEO Rahul Johri – to understand government guidelines regarding the hosting of a tournament abroad. ,"With this year's Lok Sabha elections likely to clash with the dates of Indian Premier League (IPL), the Indian cricket board (BCCI) is now seriously exploring the option of hosting the cash-rich T20 tournament outside India.While nothing has so far been said on the issue, a recent meeting of BCCI mandarins with the sports ministry officials has set off speculation that the board might indeed be looking at options to shift this year’s IPL to foreign shores. The IPL has twice been hosted abroad — in 2009 (South Africa) and 2014 (partly in UAE) — because of general elections.It’s been learnt that a BCCI delegation met ministry officials – apparently on the directions of BCCI CEO Rahul Johri – to understand government guidelines regarding the hosting of a tournament abroad. IPL formed a major part of the discussion. BCCI has been hosting the IPL since 2008 and is fully aware of the formalities regarding the organisation of the event in the country. Hence, the inference being drawn from this meeting is that BCCI could be looking at a foreign venue for the 12th edition of the tournament.“We explained to them that the key parties concerned are the ministries of home and external affairs. Apart from the other two ministries, the sports ministry’s approval is required only in case of hosting the tournament in India. Still, they (BCCI delegates) wanted to make sure about the paperwork or permissions required on the sports ministry’s part,” a source close to the development told TOI.Johri had recently stated that the BCCI was working towards hosting the IPL in India, since the official broadcaster and all eight franchises were against the idea of taking the tournament to a foreign location. Logistical hassle and revenue loss always remain important factors. But BCCI's hand has been forced in the election year due to the government's inability to provide security for the event.Other than polls, the IPL this time has to contend with the World Cup also, which will be held from May 30 to July 14 in England. Usually, the IPL starts in the first week of April and concludes in the last week of May. But that won’t be the case this time. According to Justice Lodha committee recommendations, a 15-day window is mandatory between the IPL and any upcoming international fixture.Now, adhering to this recommendation and to avoid a clash with the World Cup, the IPL has to start in the last week of March, so that the tournament can conclude by mid-May. However, that could mean a clash with the general elections.Some reports have suggested that the BCCI is looking at three possible locations if it decides to move the league abroad — South Africa, UAE and England.","Jan 03, 2019, 12:47 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ipl-2019-venue-under-speculation-due-to-clash-of-dates-with-ls-elections/articleshow/67362100.cms
Supreme Court dissatisifed with efforts by Meghalaya government to rescue 15 trapped miners; says bring them out dead or alive,"""For people who are trapped there, every minute counts,"" the court said and suggested that the help of the Army could be also taken.","NEW DELHI/SHILLONG: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed strong dissatisfaction over the rescue efforts to trace 15 people trapped in a mine in Meghalaya for 22 days, telling the state government to bring them out dead or alive.The tough talk by the apex court came on a day when the multi-agency operations to rescue the miners failed to make any headway with efforts to pump the water out of the mine not yielding any result.The 15 miners remain trapped in the 370-foot-deep illegal rat-hole coal mine in Lumthari village of East Jaintia Hills district since December 13 after water from a nearby river gushed in.""For people who are trapped there, every minute counts,"" the court said and suggested that the help of the Army could be also taken.Holding that ""prompt, immediate and effective"" operation is needed to rescue the trapped people, the court said there should not be any delay as it was a question of life and death. ""We pray to God that they all are alive.""A bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, to apprise it by Friday the steps which the government intends to take in the matter.""As the Union, you should do something now. Either you take the help of Army, which has not been done yet. They (Army) are ready and they have volunteered also,"" the bench told Mehta, issuing notice to the Centre on a PIL seeking effective and best rescue measures.""We are not satisfied (with steps taken for rescue). It is a question of life and death. What has happened in the last so many days we do not know.""""No matter whether they (trapped persons) are all dead, some alive, few dead or all alive, they should have been taken out by now. We pray to God that they all are alive,"" it said.Family members of at least seven trapped miners have already given up hope to rescue them alive and requested the state government to retrieve the bodies for last rites.The divers of the Navy and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were unable to resume the search operation as they could not go inside due to the high water level.Asked if the divers would take another chance later in the day, operation spokesperson R Susngi told PTI that they would wait, but there was a remote chance of the water level reducing so soon.Fire Service personnel from Odisha resumed work at 10 am and it was found that the water level rose again, a day after full-day pumping resulted in the water receding by 16 inches, Susngi said.During the hearing in the apex court, the solicitor general told the bench that several members of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were working at the site and instead of the Army, the government has sent Navy personnel there as the mine was submerged in water.""72 members of NDRF are already there but still no result,"" the bench observed, adding, ""Why can't you take help of the Army? He (petitioner) says that water pumps were sent to Thailand. Why cannot it (pumps) be used here also?"".The petitioner said in his plea that Kirloskar Brothers Ltd (KBL) had offered high-powered water pumps and given technical support to the Royal Thai government in June-July 2018 for the operation to rescue a football team trapped inside a cave system in Thailand.KBL offered to provide four specialised high capacity Autoprime de-watering pumps, which were kept ready at Kirloskarvadi plant in Maharashtra to be airlifted to Thailand.Mehta, while maintaining that the petition seeking urgent steps for the rescue said he would take instructions in the matter.He said the Union coal minister had held a meeting, which was attended by the chief minister of Meghalaya, and a nodal officer has been appointed.""We have requested solicitor general Tushar Mehta to look into it with regard to the urgency involved as it is a question of life and death,"" the court said.The counsel appearing for the state said adequate steps were taken and besides 72 NDRF personnel, members of state disaster response force, the Navy, fire department and Coal India Ltd were also involved in the rescue operations.At the outset, the counsel appearing for Meghalaya said they have already taken steps for rescue of these persons.""What steps have you taken? These miners are trapped there for long time. You may have taken steps but they are still trapped. You need some support from the Central government,"" the bench said.To this, the state's counsel said the Centre was also lending support to them in the rescue operation.""Then why you are not successful yet? Is it because of the water?,"" the bench asked.The state's counsel said the illegal mine where the 15 persons were trapped was connected with a nearby river.Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for petitioner Aditya N Prasad, told the bench that an adjoining mine was connected with a river and the authorities were using only pumps of 25 horsepower(hp) to flush out the water.He said the KBL had sent water pumps of 100 horsepower(hp) during the rescue operation in Thailand last year.""We need a central coordinating machinery to deal with such situations,"" Grover said, claiming that authorities have not taken appropriate steps.He claimed that persons, who have no prior experience in dealing with this type of situation, have been sent for rescue operation in Meghalaya.The PIL also sought a direction to the Centre and other authorities concerned to prepare a standard operating procedure (SOP) for rescue operations in ""mines and other similar conditions"".It sought directions to the Centre and the state to utilise the services of the technical wing of the Indian Armed Forces -- the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force -- in the rescue operation immediately.

Barry Whittaker-Gilbey, Head of Sync & Licensing, Kycker, offered their online artist development platform as a solution to the problem of monetizing intellectual property in the music industry. He mentioned that the music industry is growing stronger but not artists, as they are unaware of all available revenue sources. Their aim is to pool various income sources and present them on one platform. He believes music distribution has evolved. People using vinyl records accepted CDs after they realised that it delivered superior quality. People accept new technology once they know they can monetize it.

If the NCLT’s approval comes through, the company might consider a proposal to buy back shares worth $1-1.2 billion in the January-March quarter, sources said. The buyback is expected to be at a 20-25 per cent premium to the prevailing share price. Like Infosys, Wipro is coming off the one-year moratorium for a share buyback. A buyback can be done only once in 12 months, and Wipro last did it in November-December 2017.When TOI contacted Wipro, the company said, “We have an articulated payout policy. Currently, there is no buyback proposal under active consideration. The board evaluates our approach towards payouts on an ongoing basis.

"Value will take precedence over growth in next 1-2 years: Sunil Singhania, Abakkus Asset Manager","
We expect earnings for FY20 to inch up to 20% plus in terms of growth, says Singhania.","2019 would be a change in the sense that foreign inflows should also be quite strong both on the equity and fixed income side, Sunil Singhania, Founder, Abakkus Asset Manager, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: Will it be a great 2019 for investors or is this going to be another challenging year? First of all, any equity investor has to be optimistic. If one is not optimistic, then one should not be an equity investor. Also, in a growing economy it makes sense to be optimistic. As far as challenges are concerned, we have seen many challenges over the last few years and these will continue. I think that is the essence of life. Notwithstanding the challenges and notwithstanding fact that 2018 was a very challenging year, we remain quite optimistic about 2019 and the years forward.  But sometimes you have to be realistic. I mean in 2008, if you had become optimistic, then your optimism did not help. Now you are talking and comparing it to a very different year where it was euphoric. I do not see that in the last three-four years we have at any point of time been euphoric except for a period of six months when specifically on the mid and smallcaps we had become euphoric. The world overall has not been euphoric and that makes us believe we are not seeing an overboard kind of a market where people are long left, right and centre and are over-leveraged, In fact, it is the reverse. People have been very cautious. Investors have not been investing as aggressively as maybe their cash balances in the bank are. There is definitely not an over-leveraged situation, not only in India but anywhere else in the world. The situation is far different from the year you mentioned. What makes you so hopeful? 2018 was a year full of uncertainties -- be it on crude, on geopolitical situations or for that matter currency. Do you believe that maybe finally after that long wait, we are going to see earning recovery kick in from the next quarter itself? You mentioned it all. Oil has been a godsend for us. From $85, we are down to $53-54. Fundamentally at least, we do not see oil moving beyond $60-65 even in the medium to long-term. Currency has come back to $70. If you see the last 20 years of trend on an average, rupee depreciates by anyway between 3% and 3.25% a year but that is like a step of function. We have a 10-12% depreciation and then the rupee stabilises for three-four years. It is fair to presume that after this 10% depreciation, rupee should be quite stable for the next three-four years. Inflation is down and going forward, the way oil prices have corrected, does not seem to be inching up despite the fact that we expect the minimum support prices (MSP) for a lot of farm products to be increased and consequently the 10-year G-Sec yields have fallen to 7.25%. Internationally, there was this fear that US interest rates might inch up to 4%. They have actually fallen to 2.65%. US markets have been volatile but again my view is that it is a very healthy market and I am quite optimistic even on the US equity markets given the fact that the S&P 500 is trading at like 14-14.5 times earning which is like 7% yield in a country where the interest rates are at 3%. On the flows front, we have always had good domestic inflows over the last three-four years. My view is that 2019 would be a change in the sense that foreign inflows should also be quite strong both on the equity and fixed income side. The last point which you also touched upon is earnings. It is generally led by a couple of sectors, predominantly corporate banks. We expect earnings for FY20 to inch up to 20% plus in terms of growth. Obviously a large part of that would be contributed by corporate banks but other small sectors should also kick in. Overall, given the fact that we are not in a very euphoric zone, we are may be at around 16 times FY20 earnings and three-four months ahead, we would start to discount FY21, I think there is reasonable optimism both on the economy front as well as from market front.  My only concern with the current environment is that are we underestimating the fall in US markets? I remember this kind of situation happening in 2007 when world discovered a problem call subprime. Indian markets started outperforming for many months. Today we can take a lot of pride in saying that US market has gone down but we were up in December. We are better and we have better growth. But will that really last for a long period of time? Again you are comparing two different times and situations. 2007. as you rightly said was more of a crash over leveraged position. And in fact, I was yesterday seeing the documentary The Big Short. It is incidental that we are talking about it today. It was more about the banking system being levered up like 40 times. If you see the banking system in the US now, it is very healthy compared to 2007, in terms of their capital adequacy, in terms of their profitability etc. Second. we are not looking at PEs of 40-50 times in US. We are looking at a PE of 14.5 times for S&P 500. Again just to give you a perspective, there was a trillion-dollar buyback in US in 2018. If you add the last five years of buybacks, they have totalled around $4 trillion which is almost 20% to 25% of the market cap of the US. We are seeing companies having huge cash balances, having huge cash profits. The economy is doing very well. If you go to US and you just talk to people, there is hardly any unemployment. In fact, there is shortage, specifically on the technology side of people. I do not see a scenario of something like 2007-08 even near that and I would say that definitely things are much better and very different from 2007-08. As far as markets are concerned, even there we had this phenomena of the FAANG stocks among the technology stocks, where there was a little bit of over-optimism and those are the stocks which have fallen the most over the last three-four months. So one segment had moved up very sharply and has fallen equally sharply. It is similar to what we had in India where midcaps and small caps went up sharply, they fell sharply or quality was getting unusual premium and wherever that quality has disappointed a little bit, you have seen a sharp fall. It is more a case of over-optimism in a few stocks or a few sectors getting patted down and the fall is more pronounced there. Again, just to conclude, I do not see a scenario of like a meltdown of 2007-08, I do not see it as enything near that. In fact, if I were an investor, I would also bet on the US markets from here on.We had some interesting data thrown up yesterday with respect to the Russell 2000. A 10% fall historically has been followed by a positive year. Perhaps we could see that for the midcap index as well? Where are you seeing opportunity within the midcap universe?Over last three years, we have seen challenges which were quite significant compared to what we have seen earlier and those challenges meant that investors got comfort in the so-called growth stocks or companies which were not impacted by what was happening on the economy front. So, consumption and quality got disproportionate PE. What we are seeing now is that some kind of multiples are not sustainable if we have even a slight sort of correction in their growth rates. And we have seen that with a large innerwear company and a two-wheeler company, how the multiples have corrected very sharply. My view is that over the next one two years, value will take precedence over growth. Companies which have been slowly growing but have not seen rapid growth have been ignored by the investors and a lot of those companies are on the mid and smallcap side. Going forward, maybe companies which have value and which have been in sectors that have been ignored for their challenging past like may be a construction company, some old gen companies, capex companies. Moving towards them because they have seen sustainable addition to their balance sheet in terms of strength, in terms of their cash and the high PE stocks which were getting unusual flows just because they were performing well. Maybe, it is time to see money moving out of them into so-called value and predominantly they are even on the mid and smallcap side.I was hoping you will get slightly more specific in terms of what are the themes you are betting on.There are a lot of power generation and distribution companies which are now trading at like 7-8 times cash PE multiples. It has been sort of a taboo sector because of all the stress they have undergone over the last four, five years. But going forward, India is a growing economy and we are seeing power demand growing at 7-8%. If we believe that there is going to be power for all and standard of living is going to improve, there is going to be growth in the power generation side as well as on the distribution side because you need to take the power right to the final customers. Also, there has not been any significant addition to capacities. So, companies which have good assets on the generation and distribution side, which have balance sheets that are not stressed or which can raise a question mark regarding their survival, some of these companies will do well. Also on the EPC side, one interesting phenomenon in the September results which we were analysing is the fact that for the first time after a lot of years we have seen EPC companies not only start to generate 15-18% ROE, but have also seen their debt levels go down. This is a dream for an investor in EPC companies because over last 7-8 years, EPC companies have only seen their balance sheets bloat by higher and higher debt. These are some interesting observations and obviously there are other companies in sectors which have been ignored because they do not grow fast. It may be a very boring sector but a few textile companies would be worth looking at. They are boring, they do not grow fast but with the kind of cash which some of these companies are generating maybe in the next three, four years, you will have one period where they will give like 50-100% return. From investor point of view, we have to find whether returns can be made in a block of three, four, five years or whether you are looking at making returns every week or every month. If you are in the former category where you are cognisant of the fact that returns will be made but you are indifferent whether returns will be made in three months but ultimately will be made in a block of three, five years, there will be a lot of companies which will keep on improving their cash flows, balance sheets and that is where the focus should be. On the other hand, there are companies which are doing well, which are growing and have huge brand value, huge ROEs and are at 60-70-80 PE .I do not see a scenario of these companies making you a lot of money unless the growth rates can last for 10, 20 years. So, on the consumption side, our view is that one should stick to consumer discretionary where the penetration is still low, where you can still hope to grow in double digits for the next 10-15 years and I think one of my favourite themes, the beverages sector comes into play. But there are a few emerging discretionary consumption stories which can also be looked at but for a consumer staple kind of companies to give 50-60 PE at least I do not find merit in that.Since you track the financials very, very closely where else do you find opportunities? Can PSBs be looked at right now? Corporate banks are a sort of a consensus trade but despite that, decent returns should be made there because even now, the markets are underestimating the recovery as far as earnings is concerned. On the other sub themes, we like select niche NBFCs. The current issue over the last three, four months has meant that the competition from new NBFCs will reduce quite significantly. On the other hand, NBFCs which are well capitalised, which have a history of managing risk quite nicely over the last five, 10 years will get a disproportionate sort of growth opportunities because of lack of competition or reduction in competition. On the other sub themes we like insurance as a theme though we would like to wait for the markets to give us an opportunity which is much more entailing. I believe that India is going to grow in terms of both asset as well as wealth management businesses because of the huge savings which we have and despite under-penetration, select wealth management companies which we can play through maybe a few brokerages definitely looks to be a good option. A good thing is that valuations now are much more reasonable than what they were three, six months back and at this point of time, we would be very constructive in quite a few NBFCs across different segments. A few areas where we still have issues are obviously again the consensus kind of things which are wholesale funded with a lot of exposure towards real estate. That is one segment where we are not seeing an uptick at least as far as the high end residential markets are concerned.A lot of regulatory headwinds and savings which were going into real estate from an investment perspective have completely stopped and that also makes us believe that those savings will come into the asset/wealth management space. You are better off playing the savings part through the asset/wealth management companies rather than trying to bet on NBFCs which are more exposed towards real estate.Since you are bullish on asset managers, would you buy your previous company Reliance Nippon AMC? It is a listed pure asset management company?As I said, the business of asset management as well as wealth management is definitely good. There are near-term headwinds predominantly from the regulatory front. The reason I started my own company Abakkus is because of the fact that I am quite bullish on this segment and at this point of time my biggest investment in asset management company would be in my company.

A stock picker’s cautious bet for an uncertain year in 2019,Challenges that unfolded for the equity market in '18 have not yet receded.,"By Aveek MitraTo write about how the Indian market will perform in 2019 sitting on the first day of year is a very challenging exercise. Not because most predictions made in 2017 for Calendar 2018 by most experienced experts proved wide off the mark, but because the challenges that gradually unfolded for the equity market in 2018 have not yet shown any sign of receding.The challenges like the trade tensions between the US and China, flattening of yield curve of US bond yields, cacophony over Indian general election, slowing Chinese growth and myriad of other macro issues related to world economy and that India, have been talked about sufficiently in the 24X7 media and can be accessible to anyone interested. It doesn’t matter whether many or any of those issues would really affect Indian equity returns any which way, but they would surely keep market sentiments volatile for some time.Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Greaves Cotton Ltd  moved down by 2 in a month on a 10-point scale.

View Stock Analysis »For people like us, who focus mostly on company-specific micro issues, it is much easier to embark on the less daunting exercise of identifying a sector and then a company, where one can be reasonably assured of protecting capital in this uncertain environment with a good optionality of seeing some upside in a one to three-year kind of time frame.So, let me focus on this more modest exercise!The characteristics we looked for were: 1) A long established player with dominant position in own niche;2) Consistent record of being profitable with capital return ratios above 20 per cent;3) A debt-free and cash-rich balance sheet;4) A consistent Ebitda margin;5) Good dividend payment history and6) Protected downside and reasonable upside optionality.We also looked at trading history and found that the stock can be bought and sold in moderate quantity without much of friction loss.One company that came on our radar was Greaves Cotton. We are invested in it for some time and feel it’s worth discussing it at current price. It met all the criteria we discussed above.Greaves is almost a 100-year-old company and a leader in the three-wheeler and light commercial four-wheeler diesel engine segments and supplies to Piaggio, TVS, Atul and other three-wheeler manufacturers, except Bajaj Auto. It is the market leader in that category.Also, its genset, pumpset, power tiller and CNG engine portfolio of products are showing consistent QoQ growth over past few quarters.The key reason why the stock is quoting relatively cheap is due to flattish revenue growth over the past many years due to slackening demand for diesel 3-wheeler. This segment is in a structurally stagnant mode and may decline over the next decade. In many cities, it is compulsory to use CNG engines, and getting permits for running 3-wheelers in other locations is increasingly becoming a tough proposition.But engine sales volume has not come down for Greaves over the years, as there was always a base demand for replacement sales, and a slow but growing demand for these engines from small-sized 4-wheeler goods carriers. We feel post GST, demand of small-sized 4Ws would increase and the current level of sales volume would sustain. Their CNG engine sales growth, albeit from a low base, is increasing steadily along with sales of gensets, pumps and tillers. So, in a very conservative scenario, we feel overall sales won’t fall and profitability won’t decrease.Therefore, the stock is reasonably protected on the downside, in our view.On the positive side, the company made a major management reshuffle in 2016 –17 to make it future ready and a new set of senior management leaders joined from companies like Fiat Chrysler, Mercedes Benz, Cummins & TVS group.Under the new management, the company has accelerated its foray into developing fuel independent power train, e-mobility solutions and its after-sales service care network.Some of the key developments can be summarised as following:1) The new leap engine, developed with the help of its German partner would help Greaves cater to 1.5 ~ 3.5 T, cargo carrying diesel 4W market, which currently has market size of about 3 lakh vehicles a year. It is BS-VI compliant and, being an engine platform, it can be used across different models. We expect the company to sign up with at least one OEM in the near future.2) In the present 3W and ~ 1T small-sized goods vehicles market (their main forte), the company is coming up with petrol/CNG engines in technical partnership with Pinnacle Engines, USA. These are BS-VI compliant, highly fuel efficient and claimed to have much lower cost of ownership. This technology is protected by more than 170 patents (as per company) and can help Greaves Cotton open up a large market for itself in the petrol/CNG 3W segment.3) It is tied up with Altigreen Propulsion Systems, another US-based company, to bring in partial electrification solution as a retrofitting option, for existing fossil fuel-based vehicles. It would help improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental footprint for currently running 3Ws.4) Very recently, Greaves bought majority stakes in Ampere Vehicles, which the company feels would help it move faster in development of e-mobility solutions in the 3W space.5) It has a 3,500-strong dealer network and is currently expanding its reach up to end customer by opening about 100 Greaves customer care centres, where apart from servicing Greaves products, end customers can also get third party spares, tyres and service solutions. It plans to open 150 more centres soon in the current format. This transition to B2C would help it improve margins by a few basis points. As for the company’s long-term plan, it wants to add vehicle charging facility and battery swapping facility of e-vehicles in these customer care centres.6) Greaves has come out with a new set of higher range of power tillers and paddy weeders, which we feel, have huge markets in country like India where total market size is about Rs 500 crore and penetration are only about 3 per cent due to very low level of mechanisation. Incidentally, Bangladesh’s total market of power tillers is about Rs 450 crore. The average farm size in India is consistently declining, making a case for tillers over tractors.Now how, when and which of the above optionality would play out first is tough to predict. But GST implementation should increase demand for small-sized goods carrier, the lack of penetration of CNG would keep the market of incumbent fossil fuel-based vehicles for a long time in rural and semi-urban areas (albeit with stronger regulatory oversight to be more efficient and environment friendly) and, the rapid urbanisation would increase demand for last mile connectivity, where e-rickshaws would play a dominant role.How much of these opportunities Greaves Cotton can exploit is something we need to watch out. But we are sure of the opportunities and are tracking the progress of Greaves to see if it can encash any or all of these changing market dynamics.The stock is currently trading at a dividend yield of 4.6 per cent and at 9 times EV/Ebitda of Rs 120.(Aveek Mitra is Founder and CEO of Aveksat Equity.

6 lessons learnt the hard way in a tough equity market in 2018,,"Equity markets the world over turned quite painful for investors during the year gone by, surprising negatively almost at every turn, with some of it turning out to be major shocks. But tough markets also teach you hard lessons.Looking back at 2018, here are some of our learnings that we would like to share as we step into a New Year.1. Correlations in financial markets are not sacrosanct; they keep evolving. While interest rates kept rising in 2018, the PE ratios also kept rising (when traditionally one always thought an inverse relationship existed there). Low inflation, which at one point in time was considered good for the economy, is no longer looked at the same way, especially if the inflation remains low for extended periods.2. In a globalised economy, Indian equities could get hit for no fault of ours. The trade tiff between the US and China had apparently nothing or very little to do with India, but the repercussions that it could have on global growth momentum has a possibility of hitting our growth. Risk sentiments of investors globally are very fickle. They tend to change in opposite directions with little incremental news flow or developments.3. Political leaders and their statements (now even through social media platforms) can have profound impact on market directions. One will have to develop the capability to decipher as to what is the actual meaning of what look like simple statements by a politician (posturing vs intent). Politicians are nowadays trying to goad regulatory agencies in the desired direction using their hold over the electorate.4. Statements by corporate chieftains and CFOs have to be taken with a pinch of salt; though they are aware of their limited hold on evolving situations, they behave as if they are in the know of all things. Their agenda often is more to maintain the stock price levels than to give out fair outlook to investors. Repeated earnings disappointments prove this. The same applies to most of the analysts, who are mostly bullish on company prospects and underestimate the impact of sectoral dynamism/disruption on the company’s performance. Investors have to learn the art of dissecting the politicians’ statements and analysts’ projections in this background.5. Investors should realise that media claims freedom of speech as a right and thus need to face little or no regulatory control compared with research analysts, who appear on them. Hence, discussions by media hosts/reporters on company stocks need to be viewed in this background of lack of accountability.6. Track the sources of inflows closely. This will give an indication of emerging technical position of the market and the segments where action is likely to happen (whether largecap or mid/smallcap). Large FII flows in a short period could mean a rally that is more broadbased, while an MF SIP-led rally could mean a more focused buying with narrower breadth.Market performance may not be reflected in your portfolio valuation all the time. Investors in 2018 have seen their portfolios underperform Nifty changes significantly. Action has been limited to fewer stocks in 2018 with underperformance across most smallcap and midcap stocks.Hence even though equity as an asset class is needed to build wealth, stock selection and timing your exit right (mostly to book profits without being too greedy and sometimes even at small loss) have become even more important.

Axis Bank hikes base rate for loans by 30 bps,"Axis Bank, however, has kept its MCLR (marginal cost-based lending rate) unchanged.","Axis Bank has announced a 30 basis points (bps) hike in its base rate for loans. With effect from January 3, 2019, the bank's base rate has been increased to 9.5 percent, up from 9.2 percent. At present, HDFC Bank's base rate is 9.3 percent and ICICI Bank's is 8.85 percent. Public sector lender, State Bank of India's base rate is 9 percent. And Bank of Baroda's base rate, with effect from January 1, is 9.4 percent. Axis Bank, however, has kept its MCLR (marginal cost-based lending rate) unchanged. This is at a time when few other banks have started increasing their MCLR rates. For instance, Karnataka Bank announced a 0.15 percent hike in its MCLR. And mortgage lender, HDFC, increased its retail prime lending rate by 0.1 percent. What should a borrower servicing a base rate loan do? Borrowers, especially home loan borrowers, who are still on base rate should switch to MCLR-based loan. The base rate borrowers have two options - switch to an MCLR loan with the same bank or transfer, i.e., get the loan refinanced from another bank on MCLR mode. One may also continue the loan on base rate, especially if the loan term is nearing the end. Do keep in mind the cost of switching your loan. Also read: Things to consider before you transfer your home loan If the differential between base rate at which old borrowers are servicing their loan and the current MCLR is wide, it's better to switch to MCLR of the same bank or another bank offering lower rates.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:13 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/axis-bank-hikes-base-rate-by-30-bps/articleshow/67363008.cms
NCLAT orders Ahmedabad court to expedite Essar Steel case,"The case has been running for about 500 days, while the maximum stipulated time for the resolution of any case under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is 270 days.","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) ordered the Ahmedabad Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to resolve Essar Steel insolvency case ""expiditiously"" paving way for banks' bad loan recovery in one of the large loan default cases in the country that battles about $260 billion soured credit.The committee of creditors to Essar Steel, led by the State Bank of India, Wednesday filed an application at NCLAT, New Delhi seeking the disposal of the insolvency case within the next three weeks, ET reported yesterday late evening. The case has been running for about 500 days, while the maximum stipulated time for the resolution of any case under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is 270 days.“The committee has appealed to the NCLAT so that it directs NCLT’s Ahmedabad chapter to approve the resolution plan,” said a person with the direct knowledge of the matter. NCLAT hearded the case today noon.On October 25, more than 92% of the creditors at Essar Steel voted in favour of a proposal by ArcelorMittal, which would be the new owner of the debt-laden steelmaker that had failed to repay thousands of crores to its creditors.ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan entails an upfront payment of Rs 42,000 crore to lenders and an additional Rs 8,000 crore toward capital expenditure.Separately, a group of operational creditors and Essar Steel shareholders have challenged the CoC and the resolution professional’s decision to accept the ArcelorMittal resolution plan. About 30 vendors, who had supplied goods and services to Essar Steel, came together to petition the NCLT’s Ahmedabad chapter, seeking their dues.In November, Standard Chartered Bank, the third-largest secured financial creditor of Essar Steel, filed an application before the bankruptcy court alleging that the resolution professional and the CoC approved a resolution plan that, it alleged, did not comply with the IBC.","Jan 03, 2019, 01:41 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/nclat-orders-ahmedabad-court-to-expedite-essar-steel-case/articleshow/67363046.cms
"Yen surge, algos set off `flash-crash' moves in currency market",The yen jumped almost 8% against the Australian dollar to its strongest since 2009.,"By Ruth Carson and Michael G. WilsonIt took seven minutes for the yen to surge through levels that have held through almost a decade.In those wild minutes from about 9:30 a.m. Sydney, the yen jumped almost 8 per cent against the Australian dollar to its strongest since 2009, and surged 10 per cent versus the Turkish lira. The Japanese currency rose at least 1 per cent versus all its Group-of-10 peers, bursting through the 72 per Aussie level that has held through a trade war, a stock rout, Italy’s budget dispute and Federal Reserve rate hikes.Traders across Asia are still seeking to piece together what happened in those minutes when orders flooded in to sell Australia’s dollar and Turkey’s lira against the yen. While some pointed to risk aversion triggered by Apple Inc. cutting its sales outlook, others said Japanese retail investors were bailing out of loss-making positions. Whatever the cause, the moves were exacerbated by algorithmic programs and thin liquidity with Japan on holiday.“The moves were very violent,” said Stephen Miller, an adviser at Grant Samuel Funds Management Pty in Sydney and former head of fixed income at BlackRock Investment Management (Australia). “It would have caught some by big surprise.”Bloomberg With Japan on a four-day holiday this week, traders said they struggled to handle a flood of sell orders with pricing erratic. Once the yen strengthened past 105.50 against the dollar, others were forced to cover their short yen positions, said traders who asked not to be identified as they aren’t permitted to speak publicly.“It looks more like a liquidity event with the move happening in the gap between the New York handover to Asia,” said Damien Loh, chief investment officer of hedge fund Ensemble Capital Pte., in Singapore. “It was exacerbated by a Japan holiday and retail stops getting filled on the way down especially in yen crosses.”As a result, the yen surged against every currency tracked by Bloomberg.The haven asset has strengthened against all its major counterparts over the past 12 months as concerns over global economic growth mounted and stocks tumbled. It rose 2.7 per cent against the dollar last year, the only G-10 currency to gain versus the greenback.That hasn’t stopped investors in Japan from piling into foreign currencies as the central bank’s negative-interest-rate policy made the yen a source of cheap funding. Individuals boosted their net Aussie long positions by 45 per cent in the two weeks through Dec. 18, according to the latest data from Tokyo Financial Exchange Inc. These retail accounts’ net Turkish lira long positions were also at a four-month high.These investors may have been forced to exit positions after the yen advanced almost 1 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday, according to Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney.“We can only speculate on whether the behavior of Japanese retail FX accounts, suffering further losses on short yen positions overnight and being forced to exit, was an initial catalyst for the scale of the moves,” he said.Flash crashes have happened before in early Asian trading when liquidity is thin. The pound plunged 6 per cent in two minutes on Oct. 7, 2016 amid concerns over Brexit and speculation of a “fat finger.” Thursday’s wild moves started around an hour after Apple cut its fiscal first-quarter revenue, with Chief Executive Tim Cook saying they were surprised by the magnitude of the slowdown in the Greater China region.“The Apple news is driving safe haven flows, which have seemingly triggered a flash crash in FX,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of foreign exchange at Jefferies LLC.That added to already fragile sentiment in a week when manufacturing gauges across the world’s biggest economies all stumbled, with a Chinese indicator signaling contraction for the first time in more than two years. Factory growth in the euro area fell to the lowest in almost three yearsWhile Thursday’s sudden market turmoil came as a surprise, the fact the yen strengthened wasn’t itself unexpected, traders said. With the US and China embroiled in a trade war and stocks sliding, Japan’s currency may be set to repeat last year’s strong gains, they said.","Jan 03, 2019, 01:58 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/forex/yen-surge-algos-set-off-flash-crash-moves-in-currency-market/articleshow/67363161.cms

"Asus Zenfone Max M2 review: Large battery, excellent rear camera make it a good buy for Rs 12K","It weighs just 160 grams despite the 4,000mAh battery. ","Price: Rs 9,999 (3GB/32GB) Rs 11,999 (4GB/64GB)Specifications: 6.26-inch IPS LCD (19:9 aspect ratio, 1520 x 720 pixels), Snapdragon 632 octa core processor, 3/4GB RAM, 32/64GB storage (expandable, dedicated slot), dual SIM, 13MP f1.8 + 2MP dual rear camera, 8MP f2.0 front camera, 4G with VoLTE, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, rear fingerprint scanner, 4,000mAh, Android 8.1, 160 grams.Pros: Sleek design, bright display, lightweight with a large battery, great battery life, good day-to-day performance, excellent rear camera, loud audio output.Cons: 720p resolution display, front camera portrait mode is iffy, face unlock didn’t work for us.It’s barely been a couple of months since Asus launched the ZenFone Max M1 and its successor has already arrived. While the M1 was priced in the entry-level range (Rs 7,499), the Max M2 takes is looking to take on the mid-range segment with a Rs 9,999 price tag.There are a number of upgrades that the M2 has over M1. The most prominent one is the larger display. The Max M2 has a 6.26-inch size display with a notch — just like the Max Pro M2. We found the brightness of the Max M2 screen to be higher than the Max Pro M2 and also liked the rich colours and sleek bezels. The only letdown is that the screen is 720p (1520 x 720 pixels) and not full HD. Asus has kept a large notch and the reason for that is the inclusion of every feature that midrange consumers ask for: speaker, front camera, LED front flash, various sensors and LED notification light.We also think the Max M2 design is pretty great. It weighs just 160 grams despite the 4,000mAh battery — quite impressive. It feels sturdy even though it has a plastic back but what we liked the most is the sleek form factor. The plastic back has a matte finish which feels and looks great but the camera module protrudes slightly which can result in scratches on the glass if you’re not careful. Oppo Find X, Xiaomi Mi 8 & Other Upcoming Phones Worth Getting Excited AboutAutoplay1 of 6The Smartphones Of The SeasonJuly is turning out to be one of the most interesting months for smartphone launches. We’re going to see a lot of action across price segments says Karan Bajaj, as he does a round-up of the most interesting ones.In Pic: Oppo Find X (L) and Xiaomi Mi 8 (R).Oppo Find XThe Find X was launched just a few weeks ago and India is expected to be amongst the first lot of countries to get it. The Find X has a beautiful glass body with a motorized camera module. The front has a 6.4-inch curved Amoled display (without a notch) giving it a screento-body ratio of 93%. Inside is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 8GB RAM, 128/256GB storage and a 3,730mAh battery. The motorized camera module hides a 16MP + 20MP dual rear camera and a 25MP front camera. It also has a 3D face scanning face ID feature (with infrared emitters, similar to the iPhone X) and VOOC fast charge support. Other features include dual SIM slots, USB Type-C port and Android 8.1.Expected Price: Rs 60,000 onwards(Image: oppo.com) Asus Zenfone 5ZThe Zenfone 5Z will be the second smartphone to be available in India with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. It has a 6.2-inch IPS display in 19:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 2246 x 1080 pixels. The phone is expected to be launched with 6/8GB RAM and 64/128/256GB storage options. In the camera department, it has a 12MP + 8MP dual camera setup with OIS on the rear and a 8MP front camera. Other features include 3,300mAh battery with fast charge support, Hybrid dual SIM slot, expandable storage, rear fingerprint scanner, USB Type-C port, and Android 8.0 with Face unlock. Asus seems poised to take on OnePlus and we therefore expect them to undercut OnePlus prices by a significant margin, making it one of the cheapest Snapdragon 845 phones around. Price: Rs 29,999 onwards(Image: asus.com)Vivo NEXNEX is the other unique phone expected to arrive in India this month. Doing away with the screen notch, the phone has an 8MP selfie camera module that pops out on top. It has a 6.59-inch amoled display giving it a screen to body ratio of 91%. The phone comes in two variants: NEX A and NEX S — we expect Vivo to only launch the topend NEX S in India because they’re gunning for the premium market. The NEX S runs a Snapdragon 845 processor, 8GB RAM, 128/256GB storage and has a 4,000mAh battery with fast charge support. It also has a under screen fingerprint scanner, 12MP + 5MP dual rear camera with OIS, dual SIM slot, USB Type-C port and Android 8.1.Expected Price: Rs 50,000 onwardsXiaomi Mi 8Xiaomi’s previous premium device in India was the Mi Mix 2, launched last year. The company has announced the Mi 8 in China as their new flagship and it is expected that the phone will launch in India this month. The Mi 8 features a notched 6.2-inch amoled display in 19:9 aspect ratio and a 7000 series aluminium frame. It comes with an 3D Face unlock similar to the iPhone X (with infrared), rear fingerprint scanner, dual SIM support and runs the latest MiUI 10 based on Android 8.1. Hardware includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB RAM, 64/128//256GB storage and a 3,400mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support. It has a 12MP + 12MP dual camera setup with OIS and dual pixel phase detection autofocus on the rear while the front has a 20MP selfie shooter. The Mi 8 is also the first phone in the world with dual-band GPS (purported improved accuracy of 3 to 5 times).Expected Price: Rs 35,000 onwards      The other big update is the processor. The Max M1 had an entry-level Snapdragon 430 processor but the Max M2 steps it up to a 600 series (Snapdragon 632) processor. Our review unit was the 3GB RAM, 32GB storage variant and we faced no problems with day-to-day use. Switching between running apps was smooth, there was no issue in playing full HD videos and we could also play PUBG with medium graphics (no apps running in the background). The Max series is also known for battery life and this phone is no different. We regularly got about a day and half of from a single charge. That being said, the lack of fast charge is disappointing.The primary camera is a 13MP + 2MP with f1.8 aperture which delivers some good shots in daylight and indoors. Lowlight shots are bright enough to view on the device screen and share on social media but they suffer from soft details when viewed in full resolution. The front camera offers similar results. Both rear and front cameras have the same problem — less than adequate portrait mode. A majority of the time, it just did not deliver the desired bokeh effect. The front camera portrait mode shows you a preview with blur effect but the captured image shows no blur — puzzling! We hope Asus fixes this issue with software update soon. Even for video recording, the phone does not have EIS support which results in videos with a lot of shake.We liked the fast and accurate fingerprint scanner on the Max M2. You also have the option of face unlock but it failed to work 9 out of 10 times which makes it unusable in our books.

Security forces achieved major success in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018,"However, the successes notwithstanding, the year gone by was one of the bloodiest for the security forces as they suffered the highest number of fatalities than in any other year in the past decade.","SRINAGAR: Security forces achieved major success in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018 as they eliminated top militant commanders including Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Naveed Jatt and also 260 ultras but nearly 100 soldiers had to lay down their lives in the line of duty.The number of militants killed in 2018 was around 260 which is higher than 2017 and the highest in a single year in the last eight years, officials said.In 2010, as many as 270 militants were killed in action by security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. The number reduced to 119 in 2011. Then in 2012, 84 ultras were killed, 100 in 2013, 110 (2014), 113 (2015), 165 (2016) and 218 last year, the officials said.They said the higher number of militant casualties in 2018 was because of pinpoint intelligence and meticulous operations by the security agencies.However, the successes notwithstanding, the year gone by was one of the bloodiest for the security forces as they suffered the highest number of fatalities than in any other year in the past decade.Last year, 95 security forces personnel were killed, while 83 personnel were killed in 2017, the officials said.The number of civilians killed in violence has also been higher in the year gone by. As many as 86 civilians were killed in militancy-related violence - whether in actions by militants or in cross-firing between the ultras and the security forces or in security forces' action on protestors during clashes.The year also saw a unilateral 'ceasefire' announced by the Centre in terms of non-initiation of combat operations during the fasting month of Ramzan in May-June. While mainstream political parties and the people, by and large, welcomed the move, the militants rejected the ceasefire.The ceasefire, however, was not extended beyond the month of Ramzan even as it had brought respite to the people.Violence in 2018 started early when on January 6, four policemen were killed and two others were injured in an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast set off by militants in Sopore town in Baramulla district of north Kashmir.The number of militant fatalities in a single month in 2018 was highest in November when 40 ultras were killed by the security forces.In the second half of the year – in the four months of August, September, October and November - the security forces went on an overdrive, killing 130 militants, including several top commanders of various outfits.Earlier in the year, on May 6, security forces achieved a major success when Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) commander Saddam Padder was killed along with four other ultras, including an assistant professor from Kashmir University Mohammad Rafi Bhat, in an encounter in Badigam village in Shopian District.Bhat's life as a militant lasted less than 36 hours after he had gone missing on May 4 and had joined the HM.While the militancy-related violence continued in Kashmir throughout the year, it took an ugly turn on June 14 when senior journalist and Editor-in-Chief of Rising Kashmir daily newspaper, Shujaat Bukhari, and his two personal security officers were shot dead by unidentified gunmen outside his office at Press Enclave here.Police said Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) was involved in the journalist's killing and its Pakistani commander Naveed Jatt executed the plan.Jatt, who had escaped from police custody at SMHS hospital here on February 6 when he was being shifted from the Central Jail, Srinagar, for treatment, was later killed in an encounter with security forces on November 28.On October 11, HM suffered another setback when its top commander Manaan Bashir Wani was killed along with his associate in a gunfight with security forces in north Kashmir's Handwara.Outstanding in studies, 27-year-old Wani, who quit PhD studies in Allied Geology to join the militant ranks in January earlier in the year, had his basic education in Jawahar Navodya Vidyalay and Sainik School Manasbal. He was considered to be chief recruiter for militants in north Kashmir area following elimination of some of the top ultras in the region over the past two years.Less than a week after Wani's killing, LeT's top commander and one of the oldest surviving militants, Mehraj-ud-Din Bangroo, was killed in a gunfight in Srinagar's Fateh Kadal locality on 17 October.The militants also targeted security forces throughout the year and continued with decamping with the weapons. The ultras also intensified attacks on alleged informers, abducting and killing several of them and on many instances, released the videos of their execution.","Jan 03, 2019, 02:15 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/security-forces-achieved-major-success-in-jammu-and-kashmir-in-2018/articleshow/67363528.cms

Maggi controversy: SC revives govt's case against Nestle India in NCDRC,"SC said report of CFTRI, where the samples of Maggi noodles were tested, will form basis for the proceedings.","New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday gave the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) the go-ahead to proceed with a class action suit brought against Maggi noodle makers Nestle three years ago by the Centre for allegedly selling noodles that fell short of the existing food standards.Nestle will face the suit armed with a lab report which gives it a clean chit on this score. The Centre said it will contest this report in the commission where it claims it is representing scores of consumers.The Centre had filed a class action suit against the company in 2015 in an unprecedented move seeking Rs 640 crore by way of compensation for allegedly selling noodles containing excessive lead and flavourenhancer MSG to consumers.The company had then moved the top court seeking a stay on the proceedings until the samples seized from it were tested and analysed.The Mysuru-based Central Food Technology Research Institute Laboratory (CFTRI) has since backed its claims that lead and MSG in its noodles, the market leader in this segment, were well within permissible limits.Nestle lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi urged the Supreme Court on Thursday that it reject the government’s claims that there was excessive lead and MSG in Maggi noodles on the basis of the lab report, but a two-judge bench led by Justice D Y Chadrachud referred the matter back to the NCDRC for a hearing.Singhvi argued that the government had filed the class action suit days after the Bombay High Court had quashed an order passed by food safety regulator FSSAI banning the sales of Maggi. The High Court had gone on separate lab tests ordered by it.But the bench shrugged off his arguments in the face of resistance from the additional solicitor general Vikramjeet Banerjee. He contended that the central government should get an opportunity to object to the lab report in the NCDRC and that the court should not dismiss the case. Any such hearing in the NCDRC would come at the cost of adverse publicity that had hit sales hard last time the controversy surfaced. The company, though, sounded upbeat in its email correspondence with ET. Maggi row: SC revives govt's case in NCDRC against Nestle IndiaThe Supreme Court on Thursday revived the government's case in National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) against Nestle India seeking damages of Rs 640 crore on charges of unfair trade practices, false labelling and misleading advertisements. “We welcome the orders passed by the… Supreme Court in the Maggi noodles matter today. Nestle India had challenged two interim orders of the NCDRC before the Supreme Court in 2015,” said a company spokesperson. “…Samples were sent to CFTRI and the analysis results showed that samples were compliant for lead and other relevant parameters. …the Supreme Court, in view of reports received from CFTRI, has agreed with Nestle's contention and has set aside both the interim orders passed by NCDRC….The Supreme Court has also directed the reports received from CFTRI be the basis for proceedings before NCDRC.”“Reports show lead below detectable limits in some samples and only minuscule quantities of lead in others,” Nestle’s lawyer Rajesh Batra said in the court.Reacting to the justices as to why they should eat noodles if there is any lead, Nestle’s lawyers said: “It was explained by us that the lead is present everywhere and therefore post proper scientific evaluation, a limit of 2.5 parts per million (PPM) is fixed as permissible limit. We do not add any lead to the product and minuscule quantities can come from purely external sources like air, water and grains.”The lawyers said CFTRI results showed that in some of the samples the presence of lead has been found as traces and far below the permissible limit.FSSAI CEO Pavan Agarwal declined to comment.The top court will hear separately the other challenge pending in the court against a July 13, 2015, Bombay High Court order that had defanged the FSSAI. The regulator had moved the top court against the decision.FSSAI Sets New Packaging RulesNew Delhi: India’s food regulator has prohibited the use of material made of recycled plastics including carry bags for packaging, storing, carrying or dispensing articles of food under the packaging regulations that will come into effect on July 1.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) also banned the use of newspaper and other such material for packing or wrapping of food articles. The new regulations include Indian standards for printing inks for use on food packages.FSSAI has introduced the new rules after conducting two studies through the Indian Institute of Packaging and the National Test House. The studies showed that the packaging material used by the organised sector in India was largely safe. However, there were concerns about the use of material by the unorganised sector. They raised serious concerns about the safety of loose packaging material.FSSAI chief executive Pawan Agarwal said there would be difficulties in the implementation of these regulations, particularly as they related to loose packaging material and the unorganised sector. However, these would raise the bar of food safety in India, he added. — Our Bureau  ","Jan 04, 2019, 08:01 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/supreme-court-revives-governments-case-in-ncdrc-against-nestle-india/articleshow/67363564.cms
NCLT helped creditors recover Rs 80k crore: FM Arun Jaitley,"Jaitley said National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had started receiving corporate insolvency cases by the end of 2016 and so far 1,322 cases have been admitted by it.","Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Thursday said Rs 80,000 crore has been recovered by creditors in 66 cases resolved by NCLT and around Rs 70,000 crore more is likely to be realised by March-end.Accusing the Congress of leaving behind a legacy of an ""anachronic system"" of resolving commercial insolvency, Jaitley said the NDA government acted swiftly to recover the non-performing loans and legislated the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC).He said National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had started receiving corporate insolvency cases by the end of 2016 and so far 1,322 cases have been admitted by it. A total of 4,452 cases have been disposed at pre-admission stage and 66 have been resolved after adjudication. 260 cases have been ordered for liquidation.""In 66 resolution cases, realisation by creditors was around Rs 80,000 crore... Some of the big 12 cases such as Bhushan Power and Steel and Essar Steel India are in advanced stages of resolution and are likely to be resolved in this financial year in which realisation is expected to be around Rs 70,000 crore,"" Jaitley said.In a Facebook post titled 'Two years of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code', Jaitley said NCLT has become a trusted forum of high credibility.""Those who drive the companies to insolvency, exit from management. The selection of new management has been an honest and transparent process. There has been no political or governmental interference in the cases,"" he added.As per NCLT database, in 4,452 cases disposed at pre-admission stage, the amount apparently settled was around Rs 2.02 lakh crore, the minister added. Jaitley said the increase in conversion of NPAs into standard accounts and decline in new accounts falling in NPA category show a definite improvement in the lending and borrowing behaviour.""The early harvest through the IBC process has been extremely satisfactory. It has changed the debtor - creditor relationship. The creditor no longer chases the debtor. In fact, it is otherwise,"" the minister said.Jaitley said the Congress government had enacted the Sick Industrial Companies Act (SICA) during 1980s for rehabilitation of sick companies. This applied to companies whose net worth had become negative.""The law proved to be an utter failure. Law carried out rehabilitation, several sick companies got a protective iron curtain against creditors,"" he said.Besides, the Debt Recovery Tribunal was created to enable banks to recover every due diligently, but these have not proved to be highly efficient mechanism for recovering debt, he added.""For non-corporate insolvencies the Provincial Insolvency Act was applicable. This was a rusted piece of legislation, ineffective and had faded away because of disuse,"" Jaitley added.He said, between 2008 and 2014, banks lent indiscriminately and this lead to a very high percentage of NPAs which was highlighted by the Asset Quality Reviews of the RBI.""This led to a prompt action by the government... The IBC was approved by both Houses of Parliament in May, 2016. This was the quickest economic legislative change that I have seen being made by Parliament,"" Jaitley said.","Jan 04, 2019, 06:33 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/nclt-helped-creditors-recover-rs-80k-crore-fm-arun-jaitley/articleshow/67363611.cms

Want to change your job in 2019? Here's what your résumé should look like,You are just one résumé away from bagging the perfect job.,"New year, new you, new goals, a new résumé, and a whole-new job, may be!Applying for a job can be a daunting task. But before getting to that, you will need a solid résumé to back you up. Writing the perfect résumé seems like a struggle. Your résumé is a direct reflection of the work you do and the skill set that you have. It must show you off in the best possible way and should also be accurate.Résumé formats have changed over the years, and it's important to make sure yours meets today's standards.  Getty ImagesTwo-page résumés perform better, recruiters also spend more time reading them. Earlier, the norm was a crisp, one-page résumé. However, with the advent of email and online job applications, recruiters now prefer two-page résumés. In fact, recent research also suggests that the ideal résumé length is actually two pages.The research was conducted by résumé-writing service ResumeGo. They conducted a study involving a total of 482 professionals, who were recruiters, hiring managers, HR professionals, or C-Suite level executives. They were asked to screen résumés for different positions.To everyone's surprise, two-page résumés scored more than one-page résumés, regardless of the job level. This may help you understand it better: AgenciesAccording to a study by Resumego,  out of the 7,712 resumes that participants chose in the simulated hiring process, a whopping 5,375 of these resumes were two pages in length. (Image: https://www.resumego.net) Not only did the two-page résumés perform better, recruiters also spent more time reading them. This debunks the notion that recruiters will gloss over lengthier résumés. Now, that we've established that a two-page résumé is your gateway to your dream job. Keep these 3-pointers handy to write our résumé:- Be relevantRead the job requirements carefully and craft the elements accordingly, by either adding or deleting skills that will help you customise the résumé tailored to the job listing. Review your experiences, quantify your accomplishments. Avoid writing in first person.- Size MattersDon't be extremely creative with the font and size of the text. Try to maintain uniformity and distinguish the salient features or headers with a bolder font. But, try to stay away from using a multitude of fonts, it may just end up making your résumé shoddy.- Keep it neatThat should be your primary goal. Your priority should be to keep your résumé clear and easy to read. List your career history in reverse chronological order. Don't forget to include a short note to explain any gaps.Now, that you have your résumé in place, time for some trivia. Take a look at this résumé by an 18-year-old Steve Jobs: AgenciesA rejected résumé did not deter Jobs from following his dreams.  A close look at this reveals some glaring errors. Jobs doesn't capitalise his last name, which appears as 'Steven jobs'. In response to the question 'Access to transportation?', Jobs answered with: 'possible, but not probobale [sic]'. And, no guesses for how quickly this application landed in the reject list.Does this help you realise that looking beyond the obvious is imperative?

Buffett's Apple losses make his track record in tech even worse,Buffett’s bet on Apple -- which amounted to more than 5 percent of the total -- looks shakier.,"By Nick Baker and Katherine ChiglinskyWarren Buffett has a questionable track record investing in technology companies. It’s only getting worse with Apple Inc., which had already lost more than $350 billion in market value since October, diving Wednesday.After famously avoiding tech stocks for decades, saying he didn’t understand them well enough, the billionaire’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. stashed more than $10 billion into International Business Machines Corp. starting in 2011. He completely exited the stake about a year ago, admitting his analysis had been flawed -- a rare black mark in a career spent building one of world’s biggest piles of wealth.Now, Buffett’s bet on Apple -- which amounted to about 252 million shares at the end of September, or more than 5 percent of the total -- looks shakier. The stock fell late Wednesday after Apple slashed its revenue forecast, blaming an economic slowdown in China and saying fewer people upgraded their iPhones than anticipated.Apple dropped to as low as $144.51 in extended trading, trimming the value of Berkshire’s stake by about $3 billion. To be sure, Buffett bought most of the shares at lower prices, so he may still be ahead on the overall investment.When describing companies he was looking to acquire, Buffett once wrote that he prefers “simple businesses,” adding, ""If there’s lots of technology, we won’t understand it.”Buffett’s assistant didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.","Jan 03, 2019, 02:40 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/buffetts-apple-losses-make-his-track-record-in-tech-even-worse/articleshow/67363817.cms
China stocks falter as economic concerns take over,"
​​Most of CSI300's sub-indexes were down. The IT sector lost 1.3 per cent.","HONG KONG: Chinese stocks edged lower on Thursday as expectations of policy support failed to offset persisting worries over economic growth. The Shanghai Composite index ended nearly flat at 2,464.36, while the blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.2 per cent. The People's Bank of China said on Wednesday evening it had relaxed its conditions on targeted reserve requirement cuts to benefit more small firms. The move came after China reported its first factory activity contraction in over two years in December.But ""that policy alone is not enough to give the market an obvious boost,"" said Cao Xuefeng, head of research at Huaxi Securities in Chengdu.Cao noted that the market will react more positively to further details on tax cuts, which will come at some point this year, China's leaders said last month. ""Some in the market have said that there might be as much as 5 trillion yuan of tax cuts over the next five years,"" he said.Most of CSI300's sub-indexes were down. The IT sector lost 1.3 per cent, telecom shares slid 2.8 per cent, while consumer staples dropped 1.8 per cent and healthcare shed 2.8 per cent. Financials bucked the trend and climbed 1.1 per cent.The smaller Shenzhen index was down 0.8 per cent and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index fell 1.2 per cent.Apple Inc made a rare cut to its quarterly sales forecast on Wednesday, and, for the first time since the iPhone was launched in 2007, issued a warning on its revenue guidance ahead of releasing quarterly results.Although ""there is some impact in Apple concept stocks, most people care more about macro data,"" said Zhang Gang, a Shanghai-based analyst at Central Securities.While most sectors eased, securities companies, which typically rise when share prices are expected to jump, rose 2.2 per cent. This could foreshadow a rebound in A-shares in the coming months. ""If the market warms up this year, these brokerages will benefit first,"" Zhang added.Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura, also noted that this year may be less gloomy than the last. ""The Chinese market, having delivered a dismal 2018, is one of the least expensive markets globally,"" he said.But pressure remains on Chinese stocks in the near term, as listed companies, which were hit by the double whammy of Sino-US trade war and softer economic growth at home, begin to report their 2018 earnings, Cao noted. The largest per centage losers in the Shanghai index were Tonghua Dongbao Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Shanghai U9 Game Co Ltd and Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co Ltd , all down 10 per cent. The largest per centage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Pengqi Technology Development Co Ltd and Guodian Nanjing Automation Co Ltd, both up 10.1 per cent, Qingdao Huijintong Power Eouipment Co Ltd, up 10 per cent. About 12.4 billion shares traded on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 90.5 per cent of the market's 30-day moving average of 13.75 billion shares.

All issues raised by Congress on Rafale clarified by Supreme Court: Sushma Swaraj,"Asserting that every issue raised by the Congress on Rafale deal has been clarified by the Supreme Court, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday said in Rajya Sabha.","New Delhi: Asserting that every issue raised by the Congress on Rafale deal has been clarified by the Supreme Court, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday said in Rajya Sabha that there is no controversy in the matter, except in minds of the opposition party leaders. Unsatisfied by the minister's reply during the Question Hour, the Congress members including former prime minister Manmohan Singh staged a walkout. Congress leader Anand Sharma in his supplementary query demanded that the government make public the minutes of the meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former French President Fracois Hollande held last year on the Rafale deal in a bid to settle the controversy once for all. To this, Swaraj said, ""Anandji, there is no controversy. Controversy is there in your mind. All the controversy issues that you (Congress) raised, the Supreme Court has clarified on each of them. Please don't use the word controversy again."" She said, ""The whole country knows there is no controversy. The Supreme Court has cleared each issue. If you still think there is a controversy, then no one can reply."" To a query raised by Shiv Sena member Sanjay Raut if there was any discussion on the Rafale deal during the recent visit of French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to India, Swaraj said, ""There was no discussion on the matter."" ""On that day, the Supreme Court verdict (on Rafale deal) was pronounced. He (French Minister) was very happy. He expressed joy and felt there was no need to have discussion,"" she said. On the Indo-French fund for developing script for co- production of films, the Minister said the French delegation had visited Mumbai and had discussion with representatives of Bollywood besides meeting the state chief minister. To another query on the Jaitapur Nuclear Power project, Swaraj said that an agreement was signed on March 22, 2016 to set up a plant. France's EDF and India's NPCL are looking into it. ""Six EPR units are to be set with each unit having a capacity of 1650 megawatt. Once it is ready, it will be the world's largest nuclear plant,"" she said.

ISRO working towards Chandrayaan-2 mission launch next month,The six-wheeled rover will move around the landing site on the lunar surface in a semi-autonomous mode as decided by the ground commands.,"HYDERABAD: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is likely to launch Chandrayaan-2, the country's second mission to the Moon, next month, sources in the space agency said Thursday.""We are all trying hard.

It's on track,"" the official said.Chandrayaan-2, a totally indigenous venture, comprises an orbiter, a lander and a rover.After a controlled descent, the lander would soft-land on the lunar surface at a specified site and deploy a rover, according to the ISRO.The six-wheeled rover will move around the landing site on the lunar surface in a semi-autonomous mode as decided by the ground commands.The instruments on the rover will observe the lunar surface and send back data, which will be useful for analysis of the lunar soil.The 3,290-kg Chandrayaan-2 will orbit the Moon and perform the objectives of remote sensing it.The payloads will collect scientific information on lunar topography, mineralogy, elemental abundance, lunar exosphere and signatures of hydroxyl and water-ice, the space agency said.Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe. It was launched by the ISRO in October 2008 and operated till August 2009.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:15 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/indias-second-moon-mission-gets-delayed-again/articleshow/67364039.cms
"If this merger works, maybe the industry will move in this direction: Karnam Sekar, Dena Bank","
We appointed valuers for each bank separately and there was a huge process involved, says Sekar. ","If the experiment to combine three different PSU banks succeeds and creates synergistic benefits, maybe the industry will move in this direction, Karnam Sekar, MD & CEO, Dena Bank, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:. Analysts and shareholders are saying that the merger ratio is in favour of Bank of Baroda and it is valuing Dena Bank at 20% discount. Before the amalgamation process started, we appointed valuers for each bank separately and there is a huge process for that. These valuers were approved and appointed by the board of individual banks and over and above the valuer, there was a provider of fairness opinion. These valuers they have taken almost a month to value each bank and all three valuers sat together and followed the accepted methods of valuation like the comparative company method, market value method and net asset value method. Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Bank of Baroda Ltd  moved down by 1 in a month on a 10-point scale.                                                Subscribe Now                    Exclusively forStock Analysis                     Stock score of Bank of Baroda Ltd is 9 on a scale of 10.                View Stock Analysis »With all these methods, they have computed the value and then they have ascribed different weightages for these methods and finally arrived at this ratio. Yesterday, the board of each bank sat, examined, scrutinised and discussed in detail for almost an hour and then finally it was approved. As far as Dena Bank board is concerned, each of the board members have had a serious discussion, debate and finally we are all of the unanimous opinion that this value is very fair. We went by the valuer’s opinion and the fairness opinion. Likewise, other two boards also have done this valuation. This is the accepted process and this is also the legal requirement.  Amalgamation of BOB, Vijaya, Dena a complex process: Karnam Sekar of Dena Bank With all the approvals and ratios out of the way, now there would be an operational integration process. Do you see any challenges on issues like culture, bank book overlap, reallocation or change of team? Any merger, any amalgamation will have all these challenges and I used to keep saying that announcing merger and announcing the date that is one part but actually after the date is announced and after we start the process, that is the actual process. After the date of amalgamation also, digesting this merger will take some time. It is a huge process. Any amalgamation will have to undergo this and pre-amalgamation, amalgamation and post-amalgamation phases. All three phases are equally important and we need to work on that and pre-amalgamation is one aspect but post amalgamation, we will have to digest three different banks into one bank and then move ahead. We should not lose out on any synergies. Now before the amalgamation, we were thinking this synergy would come from Dena Bank, some would come from Vijaya Bank and that would come from Bank of Baroda. After amalgamation, we should not miss out on all the three synergies at all. We need to capture all the strengths, all the brand images and the customer loyalty. We need to improve all the employees’ productivity. Any amalgamation digesting three banks into one is a very complex process. We need to go through that. Do you think employee strength of the bank will be very high after the merger and will this need a lot of allocation or re-allocation of work? I do not think so because right now Dena Bank may not be doing some aspects of banking business. Vijaya Bank may not be doing some aspects of banking business. After amalgamation, this would be the second largest bank in the country in the public sector space. We need to do all complex, varied aspects of banking and we need a lot of manpower. Second, the banking industry in general and these three banks in particular, we have a lot of retirements coming up and we may have to expand also. Vijaya Bank is in south and Dena Bank and Bank of Baroda are in north and east and we all need to expand depending upon the business potential. So I do not think we will need a huge workforce. We need more going forward because business is going to grow substantially. Now that NPA issues have got recognised and a part of the resolution has already taken place, going forward once this problem is outside our focus, then business growth will be the main focus. Over next two, three, four, five years, a huge growth has to take place and being the second largest, we will be appropriately placed to capture this growth cake. So. we need to have more people.  Can you put a timeline to the synergy gains from the merger and can it take a long time to accrue considering the challenges?  Integration of all the processes and all and synergy should come from 2021 onwards.  We understand that Bank of Baroda will become the largest lender. What benefit and what kind of scale do you think they can get? Each bank has its own distinct advantages. For example, Dena Bank has a huge CASA base. If this is coming to the amalgamated entity, it will help the cost of funds to go down. But we need to explore by how much. Second, as the balance sheet becomes bigger and bigger, our appetite to take large credit exposures would go up especially when the limitation comes from RBI guidelines. Next year onwards, our balance sheet size also is very important. We can take a bigger share in the bigger corporate credit and that is second aspect. Third, when we have the huge branch network next to State Bank of India, our reach to the market would be much more, especially the MSME segment. The MSME segment is going to be the next big market opening up for the credit growth. This large bank with huge network will have a distinct advantage. Our capability to invest more would increase and bigger the size, bigger the growth and profitability.  Do you think that this merger marks the first step towards rationalisation in the number of operating PSBs and the emergence of four to five large banks that can over time manage operations better? This is the philosophy which is being debated for the last two-three years. We need three or four major nationwide banks and maybe few smaller banks with regional approach. The entire industry is moving in that direction. First was the merger of State Bank of India along with associates. They have done that and now this would be the public sector space, the first major experiment. If this experiment succeeds and throws out all synergistic benefits, maybe this thinking can be further expanded and further implementation may take place. After a lot of debate, this was initiated. If this works, maybe the industry will move in this direction.","Jan 03, 2019, 03:03 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/if-this-merger-works-maybe-the-industry-will-move-in-this-direction-karnam-sekar-dena-bank/articleshow/67364046.cms
"Nifty50 to flirt with 8,500 in 2019: You can still make money & how!","On the domestic front, opinion polls strongly point towards a coalition government.
","First, let me challenge a few myths. We did some quick calculations to track rolling five-year blocks and 10-year blocks for annual Nifty returns. From 1994 (when NSE started operations) till 2018, returns in the five-year blocks were not great, but a 10-year investment in Nifty had an 80 per cent chance of delivering 10-plus per cent annual returns.Over the entire 24 years from 1994 to 2018, annual returns on Nifty work out to a shade less than 10 per cent per annum. So, does it matter how good or bad 2019 is for equity market?Recent history gives some indication.Calendar 2017 was the last good year for our market with 30 per cent returns on the Nifty and huge gains in smallcap and midcap stocks. Calendar 2018 started off with a small dip, which got accentuated as soon as the Budget was unveiled thanks to the return of capital gains tax and there being not much else to offer.Soon after, crashing US markets forced our indices down. While the next few months saw the market recover and rise sharply for a while, the downtrend started again with a tense global trade and ‘imported’ sentiment impacting markets.Factors that are going to impact Calendar 2019 are more complex. In a slowing global growth, as can be inferred from falling crude oil prices and other hard data, international markets are already unsteady, with the US market off 20 per cent from their highs and Asian markets clearly bearish. Trade wars and US’ protectionist policies are adding fuel to the fire, with increased uncertainty, something markets abhor. Brexit is another ingredient in the mix. US Fed’s rate hikes are ensuring that some of the money invested in equity markets globally moves to risk-free fixed-income bonds, leading to a mini selloff in stocks.On the domestic front, opinion polls strongly point towards a coalition governmentin 2019 elections. Inflation is always a matter of concern in India. And populist government policies with an eye on elections are a real possibility, if not a certainty. Unless something drastically changes this combination, one could easily conclude that Nifty may well flirt with 8,500 level sometime in 2019.However, there is an optimistic scenario too. If the US Fed slows down or stops rate hikes, crude prices remain benign and global growth resumes partly due to these two factors, then we would be looking at smart upside from here on. Of course, general elections in India too will have to throw up a stable government to have the right environment here. And ultimately corporate performance would matter the most; great quarterly or annual numbers can eclipse almost any other parameter and really set the market on fire.So, what should one do? I see three options based on your outlook: those who are convinced that the market will fall can sell their stocks; start an SIP and hope to benefit from the fall if and when it happens and third, enter the market now and focus on the optimistic scenario. My recommendation would be to start or continue your SIP in Nifty ETFs via your equity broker with a 10-year horizon. This will ensure the benefits of rupee cost averaging, diversification and liquidity without having to worry about timing the markets. Unless you can!(Jayant Manglik is President of Religare Broking.

Turkish lira in deep trouble after another crash,"​​With volatility in FX, stocks and commodities soaring, EM FX is best avoided.","The apparent 17 per cent dive for Turkey's lira has wiped out returns for those who bought into a tempting carry trade and cranked up downside risks for the currency. Several months of relative calm and ultra-high interest rates squeezed out most of those short the lira, but the few minutes it took for TRY to unwind all gains made since rates hit 24 per cent in September will have wiped out any lira bulls. Few traders will be eager to take such risk again. Even fewer, if any, are now well hedged for a resumption of the lira's downtrend. The 5.000 mark that was the trigger for the summer's huge rally held as a support and remains the critical point, beyond which the lira is unlikely to rise without positive change for Turkey's economy.

Projects in Afghanistan speak for itself: India after Trump mocks Modi,"Trump referred to Modi as an example of how world leaders are talking about their contributions that were nowhere near the ""billions of dollars"" the US was spending.","NEW DELHI: India has asserted that its projects worth $3 bn in Afghanistan speaks for itself and has regretted the ignorance of American officials after President Donald Trump mocked PM Narendra Modi over the utility of Delhi sponsored ""library"" in the landlocked country. President Trump on Wednesday mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for funding a library in Afghanistan, saying he doesn’t know how many use it.Meanwhile, India hopes to have meaningful consultations with US envoy for Taliban peace talks Zalmay Khalilzad during his possible visit here next week for Raisina Dailogue. Khalilzad had twice skipped visiting India since November and Delhi was particularly not satisfied with India not being adequately consulted on Afghan reconciliation efforts. The Indian government justified its development partnership with Afghanistan instead of boots on the ground. ""India firmly believes in the critical role that developmental assistance can play in transforming human lives. India does not send its armed forces abroad except under the specific mandate of the UN Peacekeeping Operations,"" sources told ET. In Afghanistan, India plays a significant role as a development partner, they said. ""This partnership is built on the specific needs and requirements worked out with the Government of Afghanistan. It is aimed at the welfare of the people of Afghanistan and for a tangible improvement in the lives of its people,"" a source said, adding, ""India seeks to build capacities and capabilities of Afghan nationals and its institutions for governance and delivery of public service, develop socio-economic infrastructure, secure lives and promote livelihood.""While stating that he got along with Modi, Trump said Modi was “constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan”.“You know what that is? That’s like five hours of what we spend,” Trump said. “And we’re supposed to say, ‘Oh, thank you for the library.’ I don’t know who’s using it in Afghanistan,” Trump said.It was unclear which project Trump was referring to, but India has committed $3 billion in assistance to Afghanistan since 2001. An Afghan civil society member Parwiz Kawa said that Trump may have confused the Parliament building with the library. Indian projects have included the reconstruction of an elite high school in Kabul and scholarships to India for 1,000 Afghan students each year. India considers these as important steps as soft power connect along with Bollywood and cricket. ""India has helped to build Parliament, if that is what he is referring to or Salma Dam, transmission lines, roads and over 400 high-impact community development projects. Delhi is probably third or fourth largest single country donor,"" sources said, adding it appears that the US President’s statement is a matter of poor briefing by officials around him.Inaugurating the Afghan Parliament building in 2015 after reconstruction financed by India, Modi promised to promote programmes “empowering Afghan youth with modern education and professional skills”. Besides India has announced that it will assist 116 small development projects in Afghanistan. The Indo-Afghan developmental partnership is premised on 5 pillars. Infrastructure Projects- Construction of a 218 km road from Zaranj to Delaram for facilitating movement of goods and services to the Iranian border. The highway will connect Iran with the Garland Highway, which links Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif Herat and Kunduz.- Construction of 220kV DC transmission line from Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul and a 220/110/20 kV sub-station at Chimtala; the transmission line not only brings electricity and light to smaller towns and villages but also provides a key element of security for Afghan and US forces- India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam (Salma Dam). The Dam has an installed capacity of 42 MW and supplies water for irrigating 75,000 hectares of land. Since inauguration in 2016, the project has been generating electricity and releasing water for irrigation.- The new Afghan Parliament built with Indian support is a symbol of the democratic traditions that India and Afghanistan share. Capacity Building - More than 3500 Afghans undergoing various training programmes in India- A Special Scholarship Scheme of 1000 scholarships per annum to Afghan Nationals under ICCR- India offers 500 Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) slots to Afghanistan annually. The ITEC training is expected to address Afghanistan’s need to strengthen its administration and governance at national, provincial and district levels, including through sharing experiences and technical assistance in building capacities of civil administration and project implementation. Humanitarian Assistance- Supply of 1.1 million MT of wheat to Afghanistan- The Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health IGICH - a 400-bed hospital is the main hospital in Afghanistan that caters to the well-being of children from all across Afghanistan. Annually, approximately 3 lakh children (2.5 lakh OPD and 50,000 IPD) get treated at IGICH. Economic Development- Encouraging private investments into Afghanistan, such as through the India Afghanistan Trade and Investment Show in 2017- 116 new ‘High Impact Community Development Projects’ in 31 provinces of Afghanistan, including in the areas of education, health, agriculture, irrigation, drinking water, renewable energy, flood control, micro-hydropower, sports infrastructure, administrative infrastructure.- A significant addition to India's development portfolio in Afghanistan is the Small Development Projects (SDP) scheme, in the fields of agriculture, rural development, education, health, vocational training, etc. The Small Development Projects are implemented in three Phases- under I & II phase (total commitment of US$ 20 million) 132 projects at a cost of approx.

"If Ram temple can't be built during BJP govt tenure, when will it be, asks Shiv Sena","The agitation for the Ram temple began in 1991-92 and hundreds of 'kar sevaks' lost their lives, the Shiv Sena noted.","MUMBAI: In a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Shiv Sena Thursday said it wondered when the Ram temple could be constructed in Ayodhya if not during the tenure of the current BJP-led majority government.It said if the Ram temple cannot be built before 2019 (polls), it will be like betraying people of the country, for which the BJP and the RSS would have to apologise to them.The Sena, an ally of the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra, slammed Modi for his comment in a recent interview, broadcast by several TV channels, that any government action on the temple construction can happen only after the judicial process is over.""He (Modi) came to power in the name of Ram, however, according to him, Lord Ram is not bigger than law.

Pros and cons of buying motor insurance from a car dealer,Buying car insurance through the dealer saves time but may come with its negatives. Let's see the pros and cons of buying car insurance from a car dealer.,"With car loans available easily, owning a car has already become an effortless affair. However, taking your prized possession out of the showroom on to the roads has to wait unless the car is insured. Since long, car dealers have been offering insurance to buyers through a tie-up with the insurance company. Buying car insurance through the dealer itself saves time but may also come with its negatives. Let's see what are the pros and cons of buying car insurance from a car dealer.AdvantagesThe process of buying car insurance from the car dealer itself will certainly save a lot of time. Otherwise, one would have to get in touch with other insurers, seek their premium figures and then decide. Here are few other advantages:o The entire process of insurance purchase is streamlined and more convenient when it is done through a dealership.o As the car purchase and insurance gets bundled, the buyer may receive bundling discounts on the deal. Some car dealers may waive off the first year premium, thus sweetening the deal further. o In case one needs to go for add-ons, the dealer will be able to offer them too. In addition, few other services may also be bundled from the dealer's end.o Most such dealers have a separate helpdesk for insurance queries and claim assistance that may be of help at the time of need.DisadvantagesBuying insurance from a dealership has its own disadvantages:o In some cases, the dealers have their own pre-packaged policy with lots of features thrown-in. Not all of them could be required but still one has to pay a higher than regular premium in order to get the car insured through the dealer. o The car dealer will have tie-ups with specific insurance companies. As a customer you will be able to purchase the insurance solutions provided by these companies only. o The car dealer may not offer the best price on insurance. So, while customers save a lot of time through this purchase, they may not really save money. Car dealers work with insurance providers on a commission basis. So, the customer may be required to pay higher premiums than what they would pay if the insurance was purchased through another mode.o The process of buying car insurance from a dealer does not give you the opportunity to compare plans between insurers. This is, in fact, a crucial step in the process of deciding on an insurance policy.o Dealerships may include voluntary excesses or add-on covers under your auto insurance policy without specifically highlighting it. You should be alert and read through the policy coverage carefully before signing on the dotted line. In case your policy has a high value for voluntary excess, you will be required to pay a large part of the claim amount. Having add-on coverage that is not useful to you will only result in an increase in the premium you pay, without any other benefits.Regulatory takeIn January 2018, the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of Indian (IRDAI) had taken note of the influence of car manufacturers and the car dealers who were selling insurance and came out with this ruling - ""It is reported that the Original Equipment Manufacturers- OEM's are exercising undue influence both on the insurance intermediary and the automobiles dealer who have become (Motor Insurance Service Provider (MISP) without having corresponding accountability for their actions."" The regulator added, ""In order to ensure that MISP guidelines work in the interest of the customers, it is advised that no MISP or the insurance intermediary can enter into an agreement with the OEM which has an influence or bearing on the sale of motor insurance policies."" The move helps in bringing transparency and accountability thus befitting the buyers.What you should doAt the showroom, the entire process of buying the car may take 2-3 days. In the meantime, explore other insurers and modes of buying including online buying. Work out the numbers post discount and see what works best for you in terms of saving time and money too.","Jan 03, 2019, 03:24 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/insure/motor-insurance/pros-and-cons-of-buying-motor-insurance-from-a-car-dealer/articleshow/67364455.cms

"Shivarajkumar, Puneet Rajkumar among top Kannada actors raided by tax department",The tax department carried out raids on two top Kannada stars and three producers on Thursday.,"BENGLAURU: A few superstars of Kannada cinema and producers woke up on Thursday morning to greet, not their favourite fans, but unwelcome guests from the Income Tax department, who raided their homes, offices, guesthouses and other places in an early morning swoop to probe cases of tax evasion.The series of surprise raids, which started simultaneously, sent shock waves in the movie industry, which had not seen an operation of this scale and precision in the past two decades. The actor brothers, Shiv Rajkumar and Puneeth Rajkumar, hailing from what the industry considers as the first family of Kannada cinema, were among the people raided. Popular stars Sudeep, and Yash, and Yash’s wife Radhika Pandit, and producers Rockline Venkatesh (who produced Rajani-starrer Lingaa), Vijay Kiragandur (who produced KGF), Jayanna and filmmaker cum JD(S) legislator CR Manohar, and his brother CR Gopi were the other targets of income tax search operations. The officials arrived in private cars and presented the actors and producers with search warrants. Popular star Yash has acted the lead role in the latest multi-lingual blockbuster KGF, which was made on a budget of Rs 80 crore, and is reporting robust earnings from screens.An IT official said they had been keeping a watch on some of their transactions for the past one year, and their real estate investments. Some of the producers are also real-estate barons.The raids began at 7 am simultaneously at all their homes in Bengaluru, and income tax officials said they will continue the search for 2 or 3 more days. Director General (Investigations) BR Balakrishnan and Principal Commissioner (Investigation) R Ravichandran supervised the search operations.“We have covered big actors and all major movie producers, and will be verifying their documents,” an IT official said.According to the official, while sections of Kannada stars are under-reporting their fee (consideration), some producers are inflating expenditure incurred on movies. Earlier, a Kannada movie budget would not go beyond Rs 10 crore, but in recent money, big ticket investments are made in Kannada movies, and they are hitting 1500-2000 screens. The industry is clearly evolving and making about 160 movies a year with good earnings. But while actors are under-reporting their income, producers are getting a lot of collections from theatres in the form of cash. These collections are not getting accounted for either with income tax authorities by way of declarations or with GST authorities, the official added.","Jan 03, 2019, 11:13 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/shivarajkumar-puneet-rajkumar-among-top-kannada-actors-raided-by-tax-department/articleshow/67364636.cms
"While cryptocurrency ventures struggle for funding,  it's advantage lending","Most lenders in the crypto industry set up shop in 2017, initially offering enthusiasts a way to borrow cash without having to sell down their stockpiles of Bitcoin or other crypto assets they believed would soar even higher. ","By Olga KharifCreditors focusing on the crypto arena say they’re finding strong demand from borrowers who don’t want to sell their virtual coins at depressed prices, as well as from big investors eager to borrow coins for short selling. It’s putting lenders on both sides of Bitcoin’s bust: Helping believers pay their bills while awaiting a rebound, and also enabling bets by people who think the drop has further to go.BlockFi says its revenues and customer base have grown 10-fold since June, when Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Ventures invested $52.5 million. Aave, which owns online crypto-lending marketplace ETHLend, just opened an office in London, plans to enter the U.S. soon and is nearing profitability. And Salt Lending, which already employs 80 people, said it’s hiring more every month as its revenue ticks higher. Others Most lenders in the crypto industry set up shop in 2017, initially offering enthusiasts a way to borrow cash without having to sell down their stockpiles of Bitcoin or other crypto assets they believed would soar even higher. But when prices crashed in 2018, lenders pivoted into new roles and continued to flourish. The lending niche, it seems, may fare even better in bad times than good.“The bear market has certainly helped -- at least has fueled the growth,” Michael Moro, chief executive officer of Genesis Capital, said in a phone interview.Genesis, which launched in March to let institutional investors borrow virtual coins by depositing U.S. dollars, has already issued $700 million of loans, Moro said. It now has about $140 million in loans outstanding with an average duration of six weeks, he said. Genesis plans to more than double its staff in the coming year to as many as 12 people, and it’s looking at growing in regions such as Asia.“We’ve been profitable from day one,” Moro said. “We’ve certainly proven that there is market demand, that there’s product fit and that it’s time to invest even more in this side of the business.”The company typically requires customers to deposit around $1.2 million in fiat to take out $1 million of crypto. It charges an annual rate of between 10 percent and 12 percent to borrow Bitcoin, for example.Bitcoin has slumped more than 70 percent since the start of last year. Companies that accept the cryptocurrency or its competitors as collateral for cash loans usually demand much larger buffers to ensure they don’t get burned by falling prices. New York-based BlockFi typically requires customers deposit $10,000 of digital coins to take out $5,000 in fiat, said CEO Zac Prince.‘Low-Risk’ LendingWhen collateral drops in value, customers face margin calls, often starting with a warning that their holdings may be sold off soon. At BlockFi, margin calls are triggered if the price of the crypto collateral falls by 35 to 60 percent from the time the loan was granted. About 20 percent of the startups’ loans faced margin calls last year, Prince said. Many more borrowers added collateral when warned, he said.“We’ve never had a loss of principal,” Prince said. “It’s a low-risk type of lending, assuming you are able to manage that liquidity and track the volatility.” The company’s interest rates start at 7.9 percent.Lenders aren’t entirely immune to the turmoil so common in the crypto world. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been scrutinizing Salt’s initial coin offering -- a fundraising in which startups sell virtual coins to investors -- and whether the sale amounted to an unregistered securities offering, the Wall Street Journal reported in November, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment.‘Magic’ in BustBut most lending businesses -- including Salt -- say they are prospering and planning to expand their product offerings.“From a consumer perspective, we will start to look like a diversified fintech company - that started with loans,” Prince said. “Similar to a company like SoFi, who started as just a student lender and expanded to mortgages, wealth management, and now deposit accounts.”BlockFi is, in fact, planning to offer more credit products, including a Bitcoin interest-bearing savings account and a loyalty card earning crypto. ETHLend is working to provide its technology to other lenders in Switzerland and Australia, so they can also accept crypto collateral.“Everything flies in the bull market, but true magic happens when it does well in a bear market,” Aave CEO Stani Kulechov said in a phone interview. “The crypto-backed lending model is one of the rarest.”","Jan 03, 2019, 03:30 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/while-cryptocurrency-ventures-struggle-for-funding-its-advantage-lending/articleshow/67364299.cms

Escorts has been improving on margin while gaining market share:  Bharat Madan,"
“We do not see the same pressure continuing as we had seen in the first six months of this fiscal.”","So far, Escorts has been growing at double the pace the industry has grown for the third year in succession,          Bharat Madan, Group CFO, Escorts, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:At 27.5% growth, 4,598 units this time around, what would you attribute to this kind of a strong performance when there has been a slowdown across the board? If you look at the numbers that we have been delivering so far till November, the growth was tremendous. In December, it has actually slowed down slightly. But from our perspective, the markets where we are performing better especially the markets in the north and central India would continue to do well and we have seen very strong growth happening in these markets even in this particular month. We do not see any reason for worry as of now for the company. The general view is that there is agrarian stress in parts of Maharashtra and parts of south and that will keep the tractor demand under check. Is that true? Stock Analysis – Know before investing                            Stock score of  Bajaj Auto Ltd  moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.                                                Subscribe Now                    Exclusively forStock Analysis                     Stock score of Bajaj Auto Ltd is 10 on a scale of 10.                View Stock Analysis »There are certain pockets where there has been stress. Those markets have not done well in this month which is probably the reason we are seeing the overall industry growth being very muted at about 5% compared to 14% odd which we had seen happen till November. The rabi is a very strong season for the northern and central Indian markets. The next months should be really good for the company in these markets. You have about 10-11% market share. Are you looking at maintaining your market share? But you will not compromise on margins or would you do what Bajaj Auto did? By dropping their margins, they wanted to gain market share. If you look at the performance of the company so far, we have been improving on margin while gaining market share. That is the momentum which we will likely continue with. On a full year basis, we had given a guidance of 100 bps improvement on the margin side and that will be coming on the back of industry growth numbers. So far, Escorts has been growing at double the pace the industry has grown for the third year in succession. Our story will not be limited to the market share gain and will not come at the cost of margins. Help us understand what is happening in the product pipeline. How are your recent launches getting absorbed by the market? The last launch which we had for the compact tractors is now very much in demand. We have seen very good sales happening there. There were some issues on the production side but we are ramping up the production capacity for this product next year onwards. Our new product portfolio is doing well. Almost two-thirds now is coming from the new products in the last two to three years. We understand that you aim to generate about 10% of your revenue from exports by 2022 from 3.7% at present. Are you on track for the same and which are the overseas markets that you are betting big on? Like you said earlier, even if we compare the numbers with the industry performance on exports, it is still in the lower category. We had some gaps in the product portfolio which we have now filled up.  If you look at the numbers on the exports side, 50% growth is happening on export numbers. Going forward, by 2022, the target is to touch 10,000 tractors and we are very much likely to be on board on those numbers. Earlier this year, the management had outlined raw material cost pressure and saying it would continue over the first half while a spillover is expected in the second half as well. What is the sense that you are getting for the year ahead? So far, whatever inflation has been there in the raw material side we have been able to pass it on to the market, but going forward, the way the demand scenario is panning out, we are going to see the demand getting muted. Obviously, the pressure on commodities is now softening slightly and that is a positive sign, so that going forward, we do not see the same pressure continuing as we had seen in the first six months of this fiscal.","Jan 03, 2019, 03:41 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/escorts-has-been-improving-on-margin-while-gaining-market-share-bharat-madan/articleshow/67364758.cms

Parliamentary panel asks RBI to review capital needs for banks,"""Such stringent norms stipulated by RBI for our banks is unrealistic and unwarranted,"" the panel said.","In a hard-hitting report, a parliamentary panel has asked the Reserve Bank to ease capital adequacy norms for banks, review supervisory framework PCA, and urged the government to set up a committee to look into issues concerning accountability of the central bank as a regulator.The standing committee on finance also asked the RBI to evaluate the efficacy of its own guidelines on dealing with frauds.Besides, the committee headed by veteran Congress leader and former Union Minister M Veerappa Moily also suggested increasing the retirement of age of chiefs of public sector banks to 70 years and effect proper manpower planning and HR development strategies in PSBs.The report of the committee was tabled in Parliament on Thursday.Questioning the RBI's decision to keep capital adequacy norms higher than prescribed under global framework of Basel III, the lawmakers said the central bank has restricted lending capacity of banks and increased the burden on the government for recapitalisation of PSBs.The committee said it has been informed that while Basel framework requires application of capital standards to internationally active banks of the 21 PSBs, nine PSBs are not internationally active as also most of the older private banks are also not internationally active.In respect of the nine PSBs, (Central Bank of India, Andhra Bank, OBC, Corporation Bank, Vijaya Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, United Bank of India, Dena Bank and Punjab and Sind Bank) which had aggregate risk weighted assets of approximately Rs.9.93 lakh crore as of March 2018, this translates into additional capital requirement of approximately Rs 35,000 crore.""Such stringent norms stipulated by RBI for our banks...is unrealistic and unwarranted,"" said the report.The parliamentary panel said the stipulated additional capital requirement for these nine banks (who are already under RBI's PCA framework with lending restrictions), if waived, will release huge funds to the extent of approximately Rs 5.34 lakh crore, representing 51 per cent growth in the loan book of these banks.This will lead to generation of additional interest income of about Rs 50,000 crore annually, ""which will obviate the need"" for additional capital infusion into these banks through our fiscally constrained national budget.The committee further notes that the RBI has been tightening the screws on the operations of 11 PSBs including their lending and hiring activities under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.The RBI's revised PCA framework, implemented in 2017, monitors and classifies banks into three risk parameters based on their capital adequacy, net non-performing assets (NPAs), return on assets and leverage.""The committee would therefore expect the RBI to provide a coherent and positive road map for each of these 11 banks to come out of the stringent PCA framework within a stipulated timeframe, so that they can resume their normal banking operations,"" the report said.The panel ""apprehensive"" that the PCA framework may end up bringing more and more PSBs under its ambit.""The Committee would therefore urge both the RBI and the government to constantly monitor the situation for each of these banks and relax/review the PCA framework..."" it said.With regards to spurt in frauds in banking system, the panel asked the RBI to look into and review the role and effectiveness of various types of audit conducted in banks and its inability so far to mitigate incidence of frauds in banks.""The RBI should also evaluate the efficacy of their own guidelines of May 7, 2015 providing a framework for dealing with loan frauds,"" it added.On the issue of RBI seeking more powers, the panel said has recommend that the government should constitute a high-powered committee to evaluate the role, powers and authority of RBI in ""its entirety"", while also appraising the economic impact of the various NPA resolution guidelines/schemes formulated by RBI from time to time.""The proposed Committee should look into those provisions of the RBI Act, Banking (Regulation) Act and other relevant statutes with a view to ensuring the accountability of RBI as the regulator of the banking sector including the matter of having RBI nominees on the Boards of banks,"" the panel said.The panel also suggested that a three-month overlap may be provided at CEO level to facilitate smooth transition in PSBs.Further, with a view to utilising the expertise of senior bankers, the retirement age of CEOs of PSBs can be raised to 70 years as in the case of their private sector counterparts.The committee also desired that RBI as regulator should consider separate treatment of NPAs due to wilful defaulters and those where defaults are because of extraneous reasons such as cancellation of coal blocks and policy interventions by the judiciary and general policy changes in various sectors such as coal, power, steel, telecom, roads.For this purpose, the concerned RBI guidelines/circulars should be reviewed, said the panel's report.","Jan 04, 2019, 06:11 AM

Are the effects of GST and the shift towards branded products now coming into play a little more firmly than before?There is no doubt and looking at the performances of the other companies in our sector, this point is proved that GST has been a great boon for us and generally for the industry. Mainly the tax evaders are complaining about GST. Otherwise, GST is a very good thing. In fact, the tax rates have actually gone down, GST has brought down the indirect tax rate.A lot of players have said that the festive season has not been that great. Is this something that you have witnessed as well?The first half was really very good. In relation to that, the festive season was a bit tepid. Then peoples’ expectations go up. Our company as well as the trade feel that we are growing at a frenzy, But it was not there and there was a little bit in September October there was a bit of a setback because the crude prices were going up fast and so there was general shock and a speed break.Other players in the industry are catching up fast in terms of premiumisation of their portfolio, reduction in price gaps etc. How are you coping with the competition? What is your market share in the high-end products category?In the extreme top segment, the main competition is from Samsonite. Our market share, which was virtually nothing five years ago, is now about 20-25%. So that is very good. And then in the other popular segments and all, our market share is very high, it is some sectors it is nearly 70%.To what extent did costs go up during that period that is October when the currency fell and oil prices saw an uptick?I think nearly 5-7%. The import duties also went up 5% in September. So, there was a significant cost increase.What is your pricing strategy amidst this sharp rise in input costs?We have not taken any price hikes recently but we will do it this year. In the first half, we will definitely take some price rise. We have not finalised that. As and when that happens, we will announce it.What can we expect from VIP Industries for FY20? What is going to be your key focus area?At the end of our last year’s results, for the first time I made a forecast for five years. I had said that the last five years, our compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for profit after tax was 31%. That means in five years, we have increased four times and I said we will maintain the same thing for the next five years. Now I do not want to change my guidance at all and the guidance remains the same. Our PAT for the next five years starting this fiscal year will be 31% and that means in five years we will increase by four times. I am quite confident that we will do it and maybe after the second year, I can even increase on that target but it is too early to say anything.

Auto companies see red over cess plan to push green drive,Passenger vehicles attract the highest rate of goods and services tax at 28%.,"NEW DELHI: Automakers have raised objections to the Niti Aayog’s proposal that a cess be levied on fossil fuel-powered automobiles to cross-subsidise electric vehicles, cautioning that it would hurt a manufacturing industry bringing in billions of dollars of investment and creating thousands of jobs.Central and state taxes on passenger vehicles in India add up to 70%, making these the highest in the world, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said, urging the government to utilise the extra cess, charge or taxes currently being levied on diesel vehicles to promote environment-friendly options, instead of imposing a new cess. The industry body recognised the need to incentivise and promote greener technologies, but said it would be too premature at present to further penalise the manufacturers of conventional vehicles.Passenger vehicles attract the highest rate of goods and services tax at 28%. In addition, a cess of 3-22% is levied on diesel vehicles, depending on the size and engine capacity. Automakers have also to deposit 1% of the ex-showroom price of diesel vehicles as environment charge with the Central Pollution Control Board in the National Capital Region. Besides, the road tax on diesel vehicles is higher than the petrol-powered ones — in Delhi, for instance, it is 25% higher.The taxes levied on diesel vehicles are already similar to feebates — incentivising environment-friendly practices and penalising those who don’t adhere to such practices — and are serving the same purpose as proposed, SIAM said in a submission before the government. “Therefore, the industry feels that as long as the overall taxation on vehicles is so high and graded, there is no justification or rationale for imposing any additional taxes in the form of feebates. Any additional taxes will hurt the auto industry by making the existing technologies more expensive.” ET has seen a copy of the submission.SIAM said the industry would like to see that the additional revenue collected by central and state governments in the name of environment protection or pollution was earmarked exclusively and used for providing rebates to new energy vehicles.“There is already a subsidy (for electric vehicles) inbuilt in the tax rates outlined under GST. Electric vehicles are taxed at 12% compared to 28-50% for fossil fuel vehicles,” Maruti Suzuki chairman RC Bhargava told ET. “Besides, as far as small electric cars are concerned, I don’t think anybody can subsidise to the extent to make them affordable. There has to be technological improvements for that. If the immediate objective is to reduce fuel consumption, oil imports and pollution, one should look at creating infrastructure for CNG vehicles.”As much as 85-87% the cars plying on the Indian roads between now and 2030 would be non-electric ones, he said, adding that it was therefore important to look at the problem in a holistic manner, and not just by promoting electric mobility. “By then (2030), if you like to reduce oil import and pollution, what are your options? Your options are CNG, hybrid and biofuels. All these three technologies are required,"" Bhargava said.Any additional tax being considered on conventional vehicles should be viewed in the context of the impact it will have on the manufacturing and employment generating capabilities of the automotive sector, he said.The automobile industry, along with oil marketing companies, is in the process of making investments of Rs 1 lakh crore to upgrade vehicles and fuels to Bharat State VI emission standards by April 2020. This is expected to reduce the harmful PM 2.5 emissions from diesel and commercial vehicles by as much as 90% when compared to BS-III standards. Given the nascent ecosystem and negligible penetration of electric mobility in India, any move to penalise vehicles powered by conventional fuels will end up jeopardising the existing industry, SIAM said.“Feebates may make sense when we have made advancements in setting up the ecosystem, infrastructure and technology and reduced the applied rates of taxation on vehicles to the normal GST levels. Any feebates system before we reach that stage would be putting ‘the cart before the horse’, which can potentially do immense damage to the automotive industry,” it said.SIAM director-general Vishnu Mathur said: “India is at a very nascent stage in its journey towards adoption and utilisation of electric vehicles. At this juncture, instead of disincentivising existing technology — which is the basic principle of a feebate policy — the focus should be on incentivising and promoting greener technology. A feebate policy is too premature for a market like India.”","Jan 03, 2019, 04:10 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/auto-companies-see-red-over-cess-plan-to-push-green-drive/articleshow/67365444.cms
"Ram Vilas Paswan opposes ordinance on Ram temple, says SC judgement should be final",Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said Tuesday that the government would not take any decision on the issue till the judicial process is over. ,"NEW DELHI: BJP ally and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan Thursday opposed an ordinance on the Ram temple issue and asserted that the Supreme Court's decision on the matter should be final. ""Whatever judgement the Supreme Court gives on the Ram temple issue should be accepted by everyone, be it Hindu, Muslim or any other community. Our stand has been consistent. When the PM said that we will wait for the SC judgement, then all ifs and buts should end,"" the Lok Janshakti Party president told reporters. Asked if he would support an ordinance on the issue, Paswan said his stand has been consistent and that he would not support it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said Tuesday that the government would not take any decision on the issue till the judicial process is over. Hindutva groups like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been demanding an ordinance to pave way for the temple's construction in Ayodhya. The LJP is the second major ally of the BJP to oppose an ordinance. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had recently said that the contentious issue should be resolved either through a court judgement or mutual agreement among different groups. The Ram temple title case is in the apex court. Paswan also supported the Supreme Court judgement allowing women's entry into the Sabarimala temple. The LJP is against any gender discrimination, he said. The Dalit leader said the BJP may have protested against the implementation of the court's order but the Union government has not interfered in the matter. ""The SC has given its judgement and now two women have even entered the temple. Is the government stopping them from entering the temple? ""There should be no discrimination in the name of gender. Women are going to space, then why can't they enter a temple,"" he said. Paswan added that political parties have different views on issues. He also asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi to make his stand clear on these issues, saying that the Congress chief seems to be confused.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:17 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/ram-vilas-paswan-opposes-ordinance-on-ram-temple-says-sc-judgement-should-be-final/articleshow/67365517.cms
Here's Tim Cook's memo to his employees on why he's selling less iPhones,Cook expressed disappointment after Apple cut its revenue outlook for the 1st time in almost 2 decades.,"by Mark GurmanApple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told employees he won’t blame external factors for selling fewer iPhones than anticipated during the holiday quarter.In a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, Cook expressed his disappointment after Apple cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades. That arose from “a number of factors — some macroeconomic, and some specific to Apple and the smartphone industry.” But the CEO added that the company would set record revenues for its services, wearables and Mac businesses.Cook also invited employees to a rare all-hands meeting Thursday, where he intends to share more details about the quarter and take questions.The full memo is below:Team,Happy New Year — I hope everyone was able to rest and enjoy time with loved ones over the holidays. This afternoon we issued a letter to Apple investors explaining that we are revising our financial guidance for the holiday quarter. I encourage you to read it. As you will see, our revenue shortfall in Q1 is from iPhone, primarily in Greater China. While we are disappointed to be falling short of our quarterly revenue goal, our fiscal first quarter was also a record setter for revenue from Services, Wearables and the Mac. iPad revenue grew double-digits over the year-ago quarter, and iPhone activations in the U.S. and Canada set new Christmas Day records. We expect to set all-time revenue records in key markets including the US, Canada and Mexico, Western European countries including Germany and Italy, and countries across the Asia-Pacific region like Korea and Vietnam. Our worldwide installed base of active devices also hit a new all-time high, reflecting the loyalty of our customers and their appreciation for the work you do. We are tremendously proud of the innovations we’re delivering to our customers with iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. These are, without a doubt, the best iPhones we’ve ever made. We did not set a new record for iPhone sales in Q1, however, due to a number of factors — some macroeconomic, and some specific to Apple and the smartphone industry. External forces may push us around a bit, but we are not going to use them as an excuse. Nor will we just wait around until they get better. This moment gives us an opportunity to learn and to take action, to focus on our strengths and on Apple’s mission — delivering the best products on earth for our customers and providing them with an unmatched level of service. We manage Apple for the long term, and in challenging times we have always come out stronger. With that in mind, please join me for an all-hands meeting on Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. PT. Be sure to check AppleWeb for more details. Due to construction at Apple Park, we’ll be gathering at Town Hall on the Infinite Loop campus. Join us there in person, or via live stream through AppleWeb. I’ll have more details about the quarter, and I’m looking forward to your thoughts and questions. Hope to see you there.

"So, what's wrong at India's mines? Hear it from the horse's mouth","The last time coal issues were successfully tackled, it was because govt understood the nature of the problem.","by Anil SwarupFormer Coal Secretary, GoILast month, Union coal minister Piyush Goyal publicly stated that India does not have a shortage of coal. However, recent coal import figures tell a different story. Despite sitting on 300 billion tonnes of coal reserves, India has been perennially short of coal.After the opening up of the power sector in 2004, demand for coal suddenly shot up. Import of 21.7 million tonnes in 2006 grew to 131.3 million tonnes in 2014. Perhaps the only period when there was some level of comfort was between 2014 and 2015 when there was an unprecedented incremental growth of 32 million tonnes in coal production.Consequently, thermal power plants had an average inventory of coal for more than 20 days. Import of coal came down substantially during 2015-16, resulting in a foreign exchange saving of more than Rs 24,000 crore.Coal production had increased to unprecedented levels because there was an attempt to find the cause of poor coal production. Among other factors, those relating to land acquisition, environment and forest clearances, and shortage of railway rakes to transport coal were found to be critical.Even though land acquisition for coal mining was governed by the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, the legislation for land acquisition had brought this process to a grinding halt in most sectors. State governments with the authority to acquire land were, at best, indifferent. Environment and forest clearance was extremely cumbersome, involving numerous layers of bureaucracy.Most coal lies in inaccessible areas of the country. Hence, transporting it to the location of its use posed additional challenges. Though trains are the most economical way of transporting coal, a large number of mines are not connected to a rail network. Additionally, there was shortage of rakes on account of competing demand from sectors like food and steel.Anumber of steps were taken to take care of these problems. At the outset, planning for ramping up coal production was undertaken in consultation with stakeholders that included those involved in mining of coal at the ground level. The states, too, were involved as a value proposition.Excavation of coal resulted in an enormous amount of revenue, and direct and indirect employment opportunities in the states. Meetings with state governments were not held in Delhi. Instead, team of officers from Delhi went down to each state to discuss with senior state officers.Technology was used extensively to monitor various clearances. A web-based portal, based on the successful Project Monitoring Group’s (PMG), was put in place that was updated real-time. An institutional arrangement was made to meet critical ministries of the railways and the environment and forest every month.These steps led to land acquisition soaring to 5,500 hectares in 2014-15, and environment and forest clearance reached 3,400 hectares. All this, in turn, helped increase coal production dramatically. So then, why didn’t production grow at the same rate in the years after 2015-16?One of the biggest contributors to the increase was Coal India Limited chairman-managing director Sutirtha Bhattacharya during 2014-16 who built up a motivated team. However, after his departure, this public sector utility was left virtually headless — rather, with heads changing every few months. Now that Coal India has a chairman with longer tenure, signs of improvement are already visible.What is NITI Aayog’s prescription? In June 2017, it had floated a paper that recommended the splitting up of Coal India subsidiaries into independent companies. It isn’t clear how such a splitting will lead to an increase in coal production. Now, NITI Aayog is planning to come up with a policy to increase production. Here again, it isn’t clear how a policy would help when the issues that beset the sector are more operational in nature.GoI has already taken a commendable policy decision to allow commercial mining. The key factor now is to implement this, and not scout for another one.The factors that limit coal production, as earlier mentioned, are land acquisition, various clearances and evacuation of coal. None of these requires a policy intervention. It requires action on the ground. Can NITI Aayog make things happen on the ground? Should NITI Aayog be entrusted with this task?The last time coal production was tackled, it was not on account of what NITI Aayog did, but because the ministry understood the nature of the problem, went down to the states to resolve issues, conveyed value proposition to the states and other stakeholders, and played the role of facilitator in helping Coal India achieve record production. It has been done in the past. So, it can be done again.","Jan 03, 2019, 10:23 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/so-whats-wrong-at-indias-mines-hear-it-from-the-horses-mouth/articleshow/67365570.cms
Finance Ministry allows businesses to claim GST input credit benefit for FY'18 till Mar 2019,"Tax experts said that ITC claims were allowed to businesses earlier provided businesses had generated invoice, paid taxes and filed returns.","The Finance Ministry has allowed businesses to claim input tax credit benefit for the first financial year of Goods and Services Tax roll out, till March 2019, provided it matches with the return filed by their suppliers. The deadline for claiming input tax credit (ITC) ended on October 25, 2018.  Tax experts said that ITC claims were allowed to businesses earlier provided businesses had generated invoice, paid taxes and filed returns. However, in the recent order the CBIC has mandated that ITC claims would have to be matched with GSTR-2A.  GSTR-2A is auto-generated by the systems based on sales returns filed by suppliers.  The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) through a gazette notification issued an order stating that ITC claims for the maiden year of Goods and Services Tax (GST) roll out (July 2017 to March 2018) will be allowed till March 31, 2019.  GST was rolled out from July 1, 2017.  Besides, the CBIC has also allowed businesses to correct any error or omission in filing of final sales return or GSTR-1 for the period July 2017-March 2018. Now businesses can correct the errors in the returns to be filed for January-March 2019.

Aladdin's 'magic carpet' becomes a reality: New self-powered sheet can fly & flap,"Researchers have designed a 2D, shape-changing sheet that moves autonomously in a reactant-filled fluid.","  NEW YORK: Inspired by the magic carpet featured in the folk tale of 'Aladdin', researchers have designed a two-dimensional, shape-changing sheet that moves autonomously in a reactant-filled fluid.The 'magic carpet' in tales from ""One Thousand and One Nights"" to Disney's ""Aladdin"" captures the imagination not only because it can fly, but because it can also wave, flap, and alter its shape to serve its riders.""It's long been a challenge in chemistry to create a non-living object that moves on its own within an environment, which in turn alters the object's shape, allowing it to carry out brand new tasks, like trapping other objects,"" said Anna C Balazs from the University of Pittsburgh in the US.Researchers previously have made chemically active patches on a surface that could generate fluid flow, but the flow didn't influence the location or shape of the patch.In the study published in the journal Science Advances, the team modelled spherical and rectangular particles that can move autonomously within a fluid-filled micro-chamber.  ""Now we have this integrated system that utilises a chemical reaction to activate the fluid motion that simultaneously transports a flexible object and ""sculpts"" its shape, and it all happens autonomously,"" Balazs said.The group accomplished this feat of self-propulsion and reconfiguration by introducing a coating of catalysts on the flexible sheet, which is roughly the width of a human hair.The addition of reactants to the surrounding fluid initiates both the carpet's motion and the changes of its form.""To best of our knowledge, this is the first time these catalytic chemical reactions have been applied to 2D sheets to generate flows that transform these sheets into mobile, 3D objects,"" Balazs said. Agencies By placing different catalysts on specific areas of the sheet and controlling the amount and type of reactants in the fluid, the group created a useful cascade of catalytic reactions where one catalyst breaks down an associated chemical, which then becomes a reactant for the next of the set of catalytic reactions.Adding different reactants and designing appropriate configurations of the sheet allows for a variety of actions -- in this study, enwrapping an object, making a flapping motion, and tumbling over obstacles on a surface.""A microfluidic device that contains these active sheets can now perform vital functions, such as shuttling cargo, grabbing a soft, delicate object, or even creeping along to clean a surface,"" said Oleg E Shklyaev, a post-doctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh.

The remaining will start flowing from November 2019.A BSES spokesperson said, “Renewable energy is critical for sustainable growth and BSES is alive to it while ensuring there is minimal burden on the consumers.

"Imported ‘gifts’ may be capped at Rs 5,000 per Aadhaar number to keep tabs on Chinese etailer","Chinese etailers are allegedly taking undue advantage of customs duties exemption on gifts of up to Rs 5,000.","The government is considering sample checking of consignments and limiting the value of imported ‘gifts’ to Rs 5,000 per Aadhaar number to keep a check on online purchases of goods through foreign ecommerce platforms and applications, especially China.This comes in the wake of a large number of online purchases from China entering India as gifts and being shipped directly to customers. Under the current customs rules, gifts of up to Rs 5,000 intended for personal use are exempt from customs duties.A standing group of secretaries chaired by industry secretary Ramesh Abhishek had suggested that the revenue department examine “steps to prevent violation of existing rules to circumvent customs duties particularly by the gifting route” at its first meeting in September 2018.The minutes of the meeting have only been finalised and a decision will be taken based on the discussions. The Rs 5,000 limit can be used via any other know-your-customer (KYC) route as well and not just by the Aadhaar number.The standing group has asked the department of revenue to examine options such as tracking the source country and consignors/consignees to identify suspicious activities, the abolition of exemption for gifts to avoid ambiguity and limiting the  number of such consignments.Indian industry has complained to the government that Chinese etailers such as Club Factory, AliExpress and Shein are taking undue advantage of the exemption from customs duties on gifts of up to Rs 5,000. Officials have said that Chinese etailers, unlike their counterparts from other countries, do not ask customers for any government-issued identity proofs to complete transactions, making it difficult to track them. Besides impacting local manufacturing, the move is a violation of domestic laws.A complete ban on such imports had also been considered but the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion had suggested capping these to four per person per year, citing infeasibility of an outright prohibition.","Jan 04, 2019, 10:09 AM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/govt-considering-steps-to-prevent-misuse-of-gift-route-to-import-goods/articleshow/67376572.cms
"Buy  Marico, target Rs  425: Phillip Capital (India)",Buy  Marico Ltd.  at a price target of Rs  425.,"Phillip Capital (India) has a buy call on Marico with a target price of Rs 425.The current market price of Marico is Rs 377.95.Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Marico price can reach the defined target. Investment rationale by the brokerageDomestic business (78 per cent of sales) – commodity windfall to be used for NPDs Parachute (c.45 per cent of the India business): Management expects mid-single-digit volume growth to continue despite the premium over loose oil rising (almost 3x) and loose oil (unorganized) players starting to gradually claw back share owing to improving working capital scenario in the wake of falling copra prices. Marico’s confidence stems from these facts: (1) Parachute’s contribution from rural (40 per cent of sales) is much lower than urban areas; rural is likely to grow much faster than urban (trend for the past few quarters), and (2) market-share gains from the unorganized market (30-35 per cent of total), given consumers’ aspiration for branded products. Marico is trying to provide maximum value to customers through promotional offers (See Exh 4) and will cut prices once copra prices stabilise.Value Added Hair Oil (VAHO) – 26 per cent of India business: Volume CAGR over the past five years has been 9 per cent and management expects a similar run-rate based on a shift from heavy hair oil to light, scaling up of new product launches (see Exh. 6), and targeting LUPs (low unit packs; Rs 10, Rs 20) to drive growth at the bottom of the pyramid/rural areas. Management said that the CSD channel has stabilised after a short-term blip in 2Q; hence it will not impact volume in coming quarters. Marico’s Nihar Shanti Amla continues to be the fastest growing brand due to market share gains (43 per cent in volumes vs. 36 per cent for Dabur Amla) and consumers shifting from mustard oil to amla hair oil in north and east India. Marico has not yet seen any meaningful impact as a result of Dabur launching flanker brands in the amla hair oil space. Management said it has been able to gain substantial market share due to differentiated pricing and its social objective of contributing 5 per cent of Nihar’s profits towards girls’ education. Parachute Jasmine and Advanced continue to command 70 per cent market share within the ‘coconut value-added’ hair oils market and Bajaj Corp (with the launch of Bajaj Coco Jasmine) has not dented its share. We believe Hair & Care (light hair oil) is likely to face challenges (as seen in Bajaj Corp ADHOs) despite a recent launch of a new variant (walnut + almond) as customers are looking for efficacious products, not just those that meet styling needs.New product launches: Marico has created two separate SBUs for premium personal care and foods, as these categories require higher innovation, more risk taking, and have complex supply-chain systems. KRA (key result area) for both SBUs is long term, and it is trying to create culture that ‘that accepts failure’, which is turn helps to take calculated risks. NPD comprises 3-4 per cent of sales and it is planning to increase this to 7-8 per cent in the next 3-4 years.International business – set for a clean slate: Expects double-digit CC revenue growth in the medium term, as most macro challenges are over. Re-election of the incumbent government in Bangladesh (45 per cent of international business) and resulting stability bodes well for Marico.Commodity windfall to aid margins in medium term: Marico does not expect any material impact due to a recent government announcement of a 20 per cent increase in the MSP (minimum support price) of copra (per kg) to Rs 95 from Rs 75 because its own procurement price stands at Rs 110/kg, which is above current copra MSP. Historically, there has been hardly any correlation between Marico’s procurement price and copra MSPs. Its copra procurement costs depend more on demand-supply dynamics and it is not legally bound to procure copra at MSP. Copra constitutes 50 per cent of RM costs. The raw material’s price fell 35 per cent in mid-November 2018 (Rs 88/kg) from a peak of Rs 140/kg in February 2018. However recently, price rebounded from lows due to the cyclone in Tamil Nadu and are currently trading at Rs 100/kg (Bloomberg). Marico expects copra prices to fall once the ‘flush’ season begins in April-May.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:47 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/buy-marico-target-rs-425-phillip-capital-india/articleshow/67366078.cms
"Proposed changes in IT rules will lead to over-censorship, undermine encryption, warns Mozilla","It has also asserted that any regulatory intervention to this ""complex issue"" must be preceded by a wide ranging and participatory discussion process.","New Delhi: Government's plan to change IT rules for social media and other platforms is a ""blunt and disproportionate"" fix to the problem of harmful online content and would lead to over-censorship, technology firm Mozilla has warned. Mozilla, the not-for-profit entity behind web browser Firefox, which has been advocating data protection and privacy rights, has also argued that automated and machine-learning solutions should not be encouraged as a silver bullet to fight against harmful content on the internet. It has also asserted that any regulatory intervention to this ""complex issue"" must be preceded by a wide ranging and participatory discussion process. ""MeitY's (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology) proposals turn online companies into censors and undermine encryption,"" Mozilla said in a statement on Thursday. The comments come after the government last month disclosed plans to amend the IT rules wherein social media platforms and messaging apps will be required to deploy tools to ""identify"" and curb unlawful content as well as follow stricter due diligence practices.  Some experts have cautioned that the planned amendments, that also mandate traceability of ""unlawful content"", could invade personal privacy and free speech. ""The new rules proposed by MeitY are blunt and disproportionate solutions to the problem of harmful content online,"" Mozilla said.

Mozilla said it recognises that harmful content online - from hate speech and misinformation to terrorist content - undermined the overall health of the internet and stifles its empowering potential.  ""However, regulation of speech online necessarily calls into play numerous fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Indian constitution,"" the statement added. This is a delicate and critical balance, and not the one that should be approached with hurried policy proposals, it said. Any proactive obligation on platforms to remove ""unlawful"" content will inevitably lead to over-censorship and chill free expression, it said and added that mandating services to decrypt encrypted data, weakens overall security and contradicts the principles of data minimisation. The proposed changes, it alleged, are arbitrary and disproportionately harm smaller players. ""Disproportionate operational obligations, like mandatorily incorporating in India, are likely to spur market exit and deter market entry for small and medium enterprises,"" it added. Commenting on the issue, Amba Kak, Mozilla's public policy advisor noted that ""whittling down intermediary liability protection and undermining end-to-end encryption are blunt and disproportionate tools that fail to strike the right balance"". Underlining the need to find ways for holding social media platforms to higher standards of responsibility, Kak said any regulatory intervention should be preceded by a wide ranging and participatory consultation process.","Jan 03, 2019, 04:48 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/proposed-changes-in-it-rules-will-lead-to-over-censorship-undermine-encryption-warns-mozilla/articleshow/67366097.cms
